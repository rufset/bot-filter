  "body": "@tgxworld Dependabot is basically a script that automatically upgrades Ruby dependencies (more info about its proposed use on Discourse [here](https://meta.discourse.org/t/use-dependabot-for-dependency-updates/98823)). As the creator states that their GitHub app requires write access to the Discourse repo to allow for its patches, the app has been presently rejected for Discourse's main repo. I don't have a problem with allowing the app to write to my fork of the repo and my fork is constantly synced with that of the canonical Discourse repo so I don't have a problem with integrating patches into Discourse's master branch.\r\n\r\nThe bot is making commits to my fork using the message format you stated and to be honest I have no control over what it uses for a commit message. If you prefer I can tell GitHub to use a different merge method (squash merge) so that their commit message doesn't get logged in GitHub (the disadvantage is not giving credit to the app) and I can set something like `UPDATE: Updating dependencies` or similar if you prefer.",
