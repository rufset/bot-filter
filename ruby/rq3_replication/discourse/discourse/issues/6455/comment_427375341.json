  "body": "Awesome!\r\n\r\nAt some point I'd love to talk to you about running Dependabot on this repo - is there a good person for me to email? Would obviously be great for Dependabot, as I can't think of a higher profile, better respected repo than this one, but more importantly I hope it would be good for Discourse.",
