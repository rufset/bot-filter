  "title": "Use GitHub Actions instead of Travis CI",
  "body": "**What is the purpose of this pull request? (put an \"X\" next to item)**\r\n\r\n[ ] Documentation update\r\n[ ] Bug fix\r\n[ ] New feature\r\n[x] Other, please explain: Migrate from Travis CI to GitHub Actions\r\n\r\n**What changes did you make? (Give an overview)**\r\n\r\n- Removed travis.yml configuration file\r\n- Created 2 GitHub Action config files (one for recent node versions, one for ancient Node version)\r\n- Add `github-actions` to list of things that Dependabot will update\r\n\r\nIn general this should work the same as what you're used to on Travis CI.\r\nThe tests will run on each push to `master`, and on each pull request that targets `master`.\r\n\r\nYou might need to tinker with your GitHub branch protection settings after merging this PR.\r\n\r\nAfter you've merged this PR, I'll make a PR to add new testing status badges to the README.md file (the old badge still points to Travis for now).\r\n\r\n**Which issue (if any) does this pull request address?**\r\n\r\nTravis CI is migrating from a `.org` to a `.com` domain.\r\nIf you're running tests on the `.org` domain, those will stop working soon.\r\n\r\nIf you migrate to their free plan on the `.com` domain you'll get a one-time 1000 free build minutes.\r\nOnce the minutes are used up you don't get any more without paying or applying to their OSS plan.\r\n\r\nQuote from https://www.travis-ci.com/plans:\r\n\r\n> Free for open source. We love the Open Source Community, and to show how much we love it, upon validated request placed with our Support Team you may receive free OSS credits for your public builds.\r\n\r\nQuote from https://blog.travis-ci.com/2020-11-02-travis-ci-new-billing:\r\n\r\n> \r\n> - We will be offering an allotment of OSS minutes that will be reviewed and allocated on a case by case basis. Should you want to apply for these credits please open a request with Travis CI support stating that you’d like to be considered for the OSS allotment. Please include:\r\n>   - Your account name and VCS provider (like `travis-ci.com/github/[your account name]` )\r\n>   - How many credits (build minutes) you’d like to request (should your run out of credits again you can repeat the process to request more or discuss a renewable amount)\r\n\r\n\r\nThis sounds like a lot of hassle, and even if you jump through the hoops and get credits now, there's no guarantee that you'll keep getting the needed amount of credits in the future.\r\n\r\nGiven all this, I think it's better to just migrate to GitHub Actions, as that is free for public repositories, full stop.\r\n\r\n**Is there anything you'd like reviewers to focus on?**\r\n\r\nI have pinned the ancient node version to `0.10.48`, which is the latest release of the `0.10.x` line.\r\nI could not get the GitHub Action to work with `0.10.0`.\r\n\r\nMy work is based off the GitHub actions starter workflow for Node JS: https://github.com/actions/starter-workflows/blob/main/ci/node.js.yml, this is licensed under the MIT license.",
