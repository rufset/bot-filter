  "body": "It might be a good idea to limit what GitHub Actions are allowed to run on this repository.\r\nIt's possible for users to run arbitrary actions with a malicious PR.\r\n\r\nI recommend that the repository admin reads [GitHub docs, disabling or limiting GitHub Actions for a repository](https://docs.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/disabling-or-limiting-github-actions-for-a-repository).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n> ### Allowing specific actions to run\r\n>\r\n> When you choose **Allow select actions,** local actions are allowed, and there are additional options for allowing other specific actions:\r\n> \r\n> - **Allow actions created by GitHub:** You can allow all actions created by GitHub to be used by workflows. Actions created by GitHub are located in the `actions` and `github` organization. For more information, see the actions and github organizations.",
