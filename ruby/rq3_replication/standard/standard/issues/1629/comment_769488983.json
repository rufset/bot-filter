  "body": "## About caching without a lockfile\r\n\r\nI think using caching without having a `package-lock.json` file is going to cause problems sooner or later...\r\nAs it stand now, I can only tell GitHub action to refresh the cache whenever the `package.json` file is changed.\r\n\r\nIf a peer-dependency or transient dependency updates, it will not change the `package.json` file. (A `package-lock` file would definitely change!). Now the GitHub Action runner is using old stuff!\r\n\r\n## If you want to cache, use a lock-file\r\n\r\nI think caching is only a good idea if you're actually using a lock-file.\r\nThis will also have the added benefit of making the build reproducible.\r\n\r\nIf you're scared of having to deal with package-lock updates manually, you could consider migrating to Renovate bot instead, and update the lockfile via a automated PR once a week.\r\n\r\nOr you can just not use the cache functionality. ðŸ˜„ \r\nThat **might** slow down the tests a bit, but you're not messing around with a lock file either.\r\n\r\nI'll leave you to decide how to weigh this.",
