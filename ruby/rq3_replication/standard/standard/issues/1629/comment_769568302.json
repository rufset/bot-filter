  "body": "Great! :+1: \r\n\r\nI guess we'll cache dependencies, personally I always cache dependencies for the CI on my own repo, and I never ran into issues or bugs, maybe I'm lucky enough, and I've got faster CI.\r\n\r\n> I think using caching without having a package-lock.json file is going to cause problems sooner or later...\r\n\r\nI don't see anywhere in the docs, that we should not cache dependencies without `package-lock.json`.\r\n\r\nThat's another discussion not directly related to this PR but in my opinion, if we everyone could use exact version in their `package.json` and we didn't invented version match with `^` or `~` etc symbol, we would have less problems.\r\nIn my own repo even if it's not an npm package, I only use `package.json` and ignore `lockfiles` so it works with whatever package manager `npm`, `yarn`, `pnpm`, etc, and we don't need to manage a big ugly `package-lock.json` file, also in `git` we should avoid to commit generated files, as we do for build.\r\n\r\n> This will also have the added benefit of making the build reproducible.\r\n\r\nThat's right, but if every packages would use exact version match, we would not need to use `package-lock.json`, I know that's not the case unfortunately.
