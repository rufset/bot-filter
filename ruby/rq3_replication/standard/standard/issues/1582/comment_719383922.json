  "body": "### Is there a way to apply this configuration to the whole `standard` GitHub organization?\r\n\r\nThere is no setting in Dependabot, that I know of, to source a config file from a separate repository like `dependabot-config-repository`. I think you can use *Git Submodules* to cobble something together, but this would only work if the wanted config is **exactly the same** across repositories.\r\n\r\nSee [ProGit2 book, chapter 7.11 Git Tools - Submodules](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules) to see how that would work. I don't think this is easier to use than just using a separate config for each repository though. I think a Git submodule adds more complexity for little benefit.\r\n\r\nIf this is something that you really want, I can help you with a Renovate config instead. With Renovate you can create a base config in a separate repo that other repositories then extend from.",
