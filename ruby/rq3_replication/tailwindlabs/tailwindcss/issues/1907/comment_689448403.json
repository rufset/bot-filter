  "body": "Hi @adamwathan, I noticed you had some questions. I've got some answers for you! :wink: \r\n> Nice! Is there anything I need to do to explicitly enable auto-merging or any other custom configuration I had, and do I need to manually disable the old one?\r\n\r\n### On auto-merge support for the integrated Dependabot:\r\n\r\nAuto-merging is not supported anymore, it's also not going to be supported. Quote from the project manager for Dependabot at https://github.com/dependabot/dependabot-core/issues/1973#issuecomment-640918321:\r\n> Auto-merge will not be supported in GitHub-native Dependabot for the foreseeable future. We know some of you have built great workflows that rely on auto-merge, but right now, weâ€™re concerned about auto-merge being used to quickly propagate a malicious package across the ecosystem. We recommend always verifying your dependencies before merging them.\r\n\r\n### On removing the old `dependabot-preview` bot:\r\n\r\nWhen you're not using the old `dependabot-preview` bot anymore on any of your repositories, you can remove it from your GitHub apps. When you're logged into GitHub, got to https://github.com/settings/installations and then click on the **applications** tab, to see a list of installed GitHub apps, you can remove the `dependabot-preview` bot from that screen.\r\n\r\n### On custom configurations:\r\n\r\nThere's a full list of configuration options that you can put in the `dependabot.yml` file: [GitHub Docs for Dependabot configuration options](https://docs.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/configuration-options-for-dependency-updates).\r\n\r\nFor a overview of all the Dependabot functionality go the [GitHub docs on \"Keeping your dependencies updated automatically\"](https://docs.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/keeping-your-dependencies-updated-automatically).",
