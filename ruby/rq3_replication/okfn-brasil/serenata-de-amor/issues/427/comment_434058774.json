  "body": "Unfortunately it looks like @pyup-bot [is not prepared to delete branches from closed non-merged PRs](https://pyup.io/docs/bot/config/), thus a palliative thing to do would be to change the schedule to once a month in out `.pyup.yml`. This could be done in a PR.\r\n\r\nIn spite of that we could manually clean-up stale branches, or add a script to be run by maintainers that would automatically clean-up stale branches. Personally I think that manually doing that is safer : ) What do you think about it? What else we might be missing?\r\n",
