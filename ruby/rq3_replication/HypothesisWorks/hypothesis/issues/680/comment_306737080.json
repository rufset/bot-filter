  "body": "> reduce the Pyup frequency to weekly\r\n\r\nNo particular objections, although I’d prefer we just had a way to auto-merge PyUp PRs.\r\n\r\n> add a filter to the check-requirements job, so it only fails if a pinned version that pip-compile would update has been superseded for at least eight days. This check can use the release-date history from PyPI\r\n\r\nThat requires us to do a bunch more checking and parsing of the requirements files and so on, where previously we could just hand that off to pip-tools. I’d be disinclined to pull in extra complexity like that to the build system – all of the other `check-{foo}` jobs bring you right up-to-date if run locally, and I think that’s a good default to preserve.",
