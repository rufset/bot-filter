  "title": "Reduce Pyup dependency churn",
  "body": "A solid majority of our pull requests are simple dependency updates, which is placing undue strain on reviewers and our CI queues - especially when a single package updates several times in one day, as requests and isort have done recently.\r\n\r\nWeekly batch updates seem like a good balance - ensuring we have very recent versions without the current churn - but our `check-requirements` CI job would fail when a newer release is available but unmerged.  I propose to\r\n\r\n- [ ] reduce the Pyup frequency to weekly (see #675, replaced by this issue)\r\n- [ ] add a filter to the `check-requirements` job, so it only fails if a pinned version that `pip-compile` would update has been superseded for at least eight days.  This check can use the release-date history from PyPI ([eg](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/hypothesis/json)), and should be pretty quick if it caches responses and minimises downloads.",
