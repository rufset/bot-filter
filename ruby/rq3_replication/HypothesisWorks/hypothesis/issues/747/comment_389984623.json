  "body": "Hey team,\r\n\r\nI saw your issue over a Pyup, and thought I'd chime in. I built [Dependabot](https://dependabot.com), a similar service that already has the ability to execute arbitrary code safely. As a result, I've been able to add Pipfile support for Python pretty straightforwardly, and am about to add pip-compile support.\r\n\r\nI'm going to use the setup in this repo as a reference point, so Dependabot will definitely work with it. Would you be up for giving it a try when it's done (should be tomorrow or over the weekend)? The service is already used by a few thousand people, including GitHub themselves.",
