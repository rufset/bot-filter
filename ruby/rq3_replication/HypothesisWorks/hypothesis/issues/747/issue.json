  "title": "Pyup pulls fail when pip-compile changes whitespace",
  "body": "See #738, #743, #745 for currently-open examples.\r\n\r\nThe short version is that when @pyup-bot edits the version number of a dependency, it doesn't account for the fixed-indent comment added by `pip-compile`.  The check-requirements job therefore fails for updates that change the number of characters in a version identifier (eg 1.0.9 -> 1.0.10) because there is a diff when the spacing is restored.\r\n\r\nOur options seem to be (a) keep fixing this manually and hope it goes away, (b) ignore whitespace in the git diff for this check and accept uneven comments, (c) ask Pyup to recognize and handle pip-compile output, or (d) use something other than Pyup for version checks (eg a cron-job running pip-compile).\r\n\r\nAssigned to @DRMacIver as he has both the relevant credentials and final decision on this kind of policy.\r\n\r\nUpdate: we have another failure mode - if A requires B in a certain range, Pyup will try to update B to the latest version regardless.  Ref: #945.\r\n\r\n",
