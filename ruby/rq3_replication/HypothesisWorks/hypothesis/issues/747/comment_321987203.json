  "body": "> It is, actually - dependency checks. For example, #775 is failing (here) because pytest-xdist added a dependency on pytest-forked which isn't captured in the lockfile by Pyup.\r\n\r\nUgh, right.\r\n\r\nOK. So here's a thing we could do: The pyup bot creates branches in this repo. We have the functionality to make changes from travis already. We could have check-requirements verify if it's on a pyup branch (easy to do: Their name starts with pyup) and if so rebuild and push the changed requirements file.\r\n\r\nDoes that sound reasonable?",
