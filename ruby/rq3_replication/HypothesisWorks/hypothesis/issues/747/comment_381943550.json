  "body": "> ...having taken a closer look at the commit-and-push proposal, I don't think we can do that in a way that doesn't expose commit access to someone sneaky who opens their own pull.\r\n\r\nI think we can! A distinguishing feature that prevents this is that the pyup branches are on this repo rather than an external fork, so anyone who can push to such a branch *already* has commit access.\r\n\r\nThat being said, you and @alexwlchan are so much more on the ball than I am about picking up these pulls that it doesn't really matter to me either way, so I'm happy to leave it up to you.",
