  "title": "[RFC] Implement a security layer",
  "body": "**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\nIn light of this: [dominictarr/event-stream#116](https://github.com/dominictarr/event-stream/issues/116), we ~should~ need to consider adding a security layer for dependencies.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nThere are a few ways we could go about this, but two of them are [Snyk](https://snyk.io/) and [npm-audit-ci](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm-audit-ci) which would run through Travis. Personally, I've used Snyk as my go-to for this and have enjoyed it.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nAn alternate here would be totally ignoring the situation, but we need to take some responsibility over our dependencies.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nIf anyone wants to add their ideas for what we could use, we're open to them.\r\n",
