  "body": "@gretzky @julienben @jamesdh FYI i enrolled the react-boilerplate repo in GitHub's depandabot beta preview (members can [see alerts here](https://github.com/react-boilerplate/react-boilerplate/network/alerts)) and turned on automatic security fixes... however i've been using this feature privately for some time, and it is still very unstable and rarely opens PRs correctly. the integration does display prominent warnings for CVE on the repo homepage:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1539088/63375540-fca9c180-c359-11e9-9337-de3f96c218e6.png)\r\n\r\nwhich is nice, but it's been working on a PR to upgrade lodash since yesterday ðŸ˜• ",
