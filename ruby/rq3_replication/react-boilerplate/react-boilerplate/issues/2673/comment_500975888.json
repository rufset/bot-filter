  "body": "Also, I'm not sure switching to a frequent release schedule is a good idea for us because this is a boilerplate and the users would feel unable to follow if we released constantly. More incremental upgrades make it easier to follow what's going on.\r\n\r\nCan we maybe configure RenovateBot to make a once-per-month PRs with patch+minor version upgrades to `master` and all major dependency upgrades to `dev`? That could work well I think.",
