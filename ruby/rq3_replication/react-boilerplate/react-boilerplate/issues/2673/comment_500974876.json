  "body": "Very interesting feature request! Thanks for sharing, it'd definitely be nice to always have fresh dependencies.\r\n\r\nHave you used it on your projects? I have a couple questions because I feel like it maybe clashes with the way we work with `git`.\r\n\r\nWe have a `dev` branch which is ahead of `master` (new features, maintenance, etc.) and `dev` is merged into `master` whenever we release a new version.\r\n\r\nTo which branch does it make the PRs? I'm assuming it's configurable?\r\n\r\nIf we go with `dev`, we'd have to merge to `master` and release a new version on every PR. If not, the purpose would be defeated.\r\n\r\nIn this case, it negates the need for a `dev` branch and I guess we'd adopt trunk-based development.\r\n\r\nIf it's `master`, how does it work with `dev`? Would we have to merge `master` into `dev` regularly? Inconvenient but could be the best way to do this.",
