  "body": "In my fork I merged in a config that batches together minor updates, drastically reducing initial noise. I then went ahead and merged the Renovate PR that contained all of those minor updates. There are currently 9 more major version updates remaining. Those will be PR'd individually given the current config. \r\n\r\nFeel free to take a look and if you maintainers feel it's helpful then I can PR my fork back into this. Then it's just a matter of someone approving the apps access. ",
