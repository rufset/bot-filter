  "body": "The following config should do similar to what I described above except with the following changes: \r\n- every weekend instead of monthly. I figured you don't need to merge the PR, and it shouldn't hurt to just have it out there so you're aware of it, but obviously that's easy to change.\r\n- reduced it to only 3 concurrent PR's, which helps avoid conflicts in your package lock files\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"extends\": [\r\n    \"config:base\"\r\n  ],\r\n  \"baseBranches\": [\"dev\"],\r\n  \"packageRules\": [\r\n    {\r\n      \"packagePatterns\": [\r\n        \"*\"\r\n      ],\r\n      \"minor\": {\r\n        \"groupName\": \"all non-major dependencies\",\r\n        \"groupSlug\": \"all-minor-patch\"\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  ],\r\n  \"prHourlyLimit\": 0,\r\n  \"prConcurrentLimit\": 3,\r\n  \"schedule\": [\"every weekend\"]\r\n}\r\n```",
