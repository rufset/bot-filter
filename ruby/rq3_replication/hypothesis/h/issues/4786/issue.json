  "title": "Run unit tests under Python 3",
  "body": "The \"h\" codebase is supposed to be Python 3 compatible / ready for a migration to Python 3. We've been continuing to use Python 2.7 since we were blocked waiting for dependencies (eg. gunicorn) to migrate. That has now happened.\r\n\r\nHowever we haven't actually been running unit tests under Python 3 so naturally various failures have crept in over time.\r\n\r\nThis PR:\r\n\r\n- Adds a Travis job which runs our unit tests (not functional yet) under Python 3 and compares the actual failures to a whitelist of current known failures. This will stop new failures from creeping in and provide a way to incrementally fix the existing failures.\r\n- Fixes a small set of existing failures which interfere with pytest's test collection.\r\n",
