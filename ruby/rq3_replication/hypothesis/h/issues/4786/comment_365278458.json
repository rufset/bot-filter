  "body": "> Will the comparison to the whitelist break whenever a test is deleted or added before the end of the file?\r\n\r\nHmm, yes indeed they will. This might not be a problem since I have a set of PRs lined up to fix the remaining issues so I'm hoping this won't live for very long. However, ignoring line numbers in the diff would resolve the issue. I'm happy to go either way on this.\r\n\r\n> I wonder, do we need to update the versions of any of our dependencies before we can go Python 3?\r\n\r\nI got all the unit and functional tests passing locally and the app itself appeared to function fine with no dependency upgrades, with one exception. That exception was that tasks dispatched to workers did not run. It might be the case that a Celery update is required.",
