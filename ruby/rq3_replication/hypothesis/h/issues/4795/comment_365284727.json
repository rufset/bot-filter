  "body": "I suspect that enabling this for all dependencies is going to drown us in updates, possibly without providing that much value to the project. I also know that we have at least some major dependencies where the update will require some work. eg. Pyramid 1.9 changed a few things with how CSRF handling works.\r\n\r\nWould it be possible to scope this to just a few dependencies to see how we get on?",
