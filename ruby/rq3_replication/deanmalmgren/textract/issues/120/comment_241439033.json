  "body": "Thanks for opening up this as an issue, @pr3d4t0r! I'm glad to hear you are nearing distribution; that is very exciting indeed :)\n\nAs I mentioned in [our twitter conversation](https://twitter.com/ciurana/status/766486722704134144), perhaps we can separately install the GPL packages as `extra_requires` so that we can do things like `pip install textract[GPL]`, which not only installs all of the non-GPL code (which will continue to happen by default), but will also install the GPL'ed code. This looks like a good [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19096155/setuptools-and-pip-choice-of-minimal-and-complete-install) for this. What would you think of this solution?\n",
