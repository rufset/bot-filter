  "body": "> We shouldn't have HISTORY.rst and CHANGES.rst, it's confusing for both users and pyup.\r\n\r\nWhile I agree that this is confusing, it isn't a problem for pyup to parse the changelog. The underlying issue is that the `1.3.5` changelog wasn't merged back into master and seems to only appear on the `1.3` branch.\r\n\r\nI can understand why that's been done, but I think that's even more confusing. As a user (and tool author) I'd expect to see the full changelog of all available releases on the master branch.\r\n",
