  "body": "> It is great that we are looking for alternatives to NVM if NVM is causing problems. Could you expand on the problems we are trying to solve with `volta`?\r\n\r\nI found @noahtallen’s [comment on the related Gutenberg PR](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/28967#pullrequestreview-592707444) helpful in this regard. With volta, you no longer need to `nvm i && nvm use`. Instead, you should automatically use the correct node version for the project. That’s nice when on an interactive shell but perhaps more useful in the context of other tools that might otherwise end up using the incorrect version.\r\n\r\nDropping `nvm` in Calypso would be fine with me. \r\n\r\n",
