  "title": "Framework: Add lerna to publish @automattic/simple-components (Take Two)",
  "body": "Add `lerna` (a monorepo tool) to Calypso, and use it to publish [`@automattic/simple-components`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@automattic/simple-components) as a separate npm.\r\n\r\nThis involves adding a `package.json`, `.gitignore`, and `.npmignore` to `client/components`, and an `alias` field to Calypso's webpack configs.\r\n\r\nSince we want Calypso (and possibly other consumers) to continue to use untranspiled code (to benefit from features such as tree-shaking), the npms we produce should contain both transpiled and untranspiled versions of the code. See http://2ality.com/2017/07/npm-packages-via-babel.html, and for more information, http://2ality.com/2017/04/transpiling-dependencies-babel.html and http://2ality.com/2017/06/pkg-esnext.html.\r\n\r\nPlease note https://github.com/Automattic/wp-calypso/pull/16782#discussion_r131103930!\r\n\r\nTo test:\r\n* Run `npm run distclean && npm start`\r\n* Verify that Calypso works\r\n* Note that `node_modules/@automattic/simple-components` is a symlink to `client/components/`!\r\n* Also verify that building (`npm run build-docker`) and running (`npm run docker`) the Docker container still works (see PCYsg-5XR-p2).\r\n\r\nTo publish the npm (only if you know what you're doing! :stuck_out_tongue:):\r\n* Run `npx lerna publish --skip-git` \r\n  * If you have 2fa (in auth-and-writes mode) enabled for your npm account, you need to prepend `NPM_CONFIG_OTP=<your2FAcode>` to that command -- and be quick before it expires while attempting to publish! Related: https://github.com/lerna/lerna/issues/1091 \r\n* When asked for version, select `Prerelease` for `@automattic/simple-components`!)\r\n\r\nRelated (but not required for this PR!): #19698.\r\nTake One was #16782.",
