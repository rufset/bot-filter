  "body": "I pushed a fix for the bug where `core-js` polyfills failed to load.\r\n\r\nAs `core-js` is not a direct dependency in `package.json`, we rely on it being promoted to the top-level `node_modules` directory. The latest version is 2.5.7.\r\n\r\nBut there is package `fbjs` that depends on 1.x version. The `jsx-to-string` package your branch added depends on `fbjs`, too. Suddenly, core-js@1.x started winning the race to the top.\r\n\r\nThe transpiled `@babel/polyfill` suddenly tries to import modules from core-js@1.x which misses a lot of recent es7 polyfills. Crash!\r\n\r\nFixed by adding `core-js@2.5.7` as a top-level Calypso dependency. Also recommended (in a very obscure way though) in [Babel docs](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-preset-env/#usebuiltins).\r\n\r\nI also pushed a revert of #26094, as it's no longer interesting.",
