  "body": "Hi @rsimha, thanks - I was really excited to see that pop up in my GitHub feed yesterday. \r\n\r\nFYI, I set up a \"mirror\" fork of this main amphtml project a while back to test Renovate on, because I could see that there still seems to be a large number of out of date dependencies here.\r\n\r\nI call it a mirror because it is a fork that syncs automatically with the ampproject/amphtml `master` branch once a day, which then allows Renovate to generate PRs with the same details as if it were running on the main repository. \r\n\r\nYou can see that there are 20+ PRs listed here: https://github.com/renovate-mirrors/amphtml/pulls\r\n\r\nYou can actually use this \"mirror\" repository already to create PRs yourself for the main amphtml project using the following approach:\r\n\r\n1. Open a mirror PR you're interested in, e.g. https://github.com/renovate-mirrors/amphtml/pull/10\r\n2. Click on the branch name that's just below the PR title, e.g. `renovate/express-4.x`. It will take you to a URL like https://github.com/renovate-mirrors/amphtml/tree/renovate%2Fexpress-4.x\r\n3. Click on the \"Compare\" button, it should take you to a URL like https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/compare/master...renovate-mirrors:renovate/express-4.x which is comparing the mirror's PR branch to the main project's master\r\n4. Click the Create Pull Request button to create a PR to the *main* repository with yourself as author\r\n\r\nObviously the above is not as convenient as if Renovate was running on the main repo itself, but I still hope it will be a useful way to fill in some dependency updates which are otherwise missing.",
