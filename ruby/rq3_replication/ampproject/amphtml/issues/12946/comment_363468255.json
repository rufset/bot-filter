  "body": "I just looked for the other `package.json` files.\r\n\r\n```\r\n./validator/nodejs/package.json\r\n./validator/package.json\r\n./validator/gulpjs/package.json\r\n./validator/webui/package.json\r\n./extensions/amp-viewer-integration/0.1/messaging/package.json\r\n./package.json\r\n./build-system/tasks/package.json\r\n```\r\n- The one in `extensions/amp-viewer-integration/0.1/messaging` is something we publish, and has no dependencies to maintain.\r\n- The one in `build-system/tasks` is unused and can be deleted.\r\n- This leaves us with the four in `validator/`, which are owned by the Validator team. IIUC, the code in `validator/` is developed internal to Google, and periodically merged to Github, so I'm not sure how the dependency versions are updated, or if it's required that the versions be updated manually. Adding @Gregable and @powdercloud to see if dependency maintenance is something they're interested in.",
