  "body": "**Renovate**\r\n\r\n- fork mode (\"Forking Renovate\")\r\n  - GreenKeeper has a legitimate reason for write access to repo because it adds labels to PR; this was done to avoid impersonation (not impersonating a commit, but someone creating an account called \"Greenkeeper\" with different characters)\r\n  - Renovate does request permission for write access to issues to label their own PRs\r\n  - design doc has details on exactly which permissions are asked for and why\r\n  - Malte's a fan of the forking mode\r\n- doesn't trigger a PR build & a push build\r\n- switchover cost\r\n  - very quick to install it as an app\r\n  - there's an onboarding PR (configure renovate) with a preview; you can also add config (e.g. send all PRs to someone)\r\n- Raghu: there are some clear advantages to this\r\n- a followup meeting will be scheduled to discuss",
