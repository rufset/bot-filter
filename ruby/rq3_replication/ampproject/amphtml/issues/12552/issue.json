This allows us to spend more time on discussion of the design.\r\n\r\nWe rotate our design review between times that work better for different parts of the world as described in our [design review documentation](https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/blob/master/contributing/design-reviews.md), but you are welcome to attend any design review.  If you cannot make any of the design reviews but have a design to discuss please let mrjoro@ know on [Slack](https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#discussion-channels) and we will find a time that works for you.",
