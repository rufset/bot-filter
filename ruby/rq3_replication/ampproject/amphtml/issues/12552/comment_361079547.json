  "body": "**high entropy page_view_id**\r\n\r\n- Malte: not really a problem to increase the entropy; 128 bits is probably overkill... 64 bits is probably enough (to have a smaller string)\r\n- could make it configurable, but then we'd have to cache them; we could do it and enforce an upper bound (e.g. if they specify 128 we'd still use 64)\r\n  - upper bound can be an issue because people think they have more security than they are\r\n- will discuss in the PR",
