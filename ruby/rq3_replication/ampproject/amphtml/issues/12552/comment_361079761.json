  "body": "**document level infinite scroll**\r\n\r\n- meant for third party content?  no, for first party (same origin) content for now\r\n  - future proposal would cover third party content\r\n  - potential users have been happy with this solution\r\n- how are we determining limits to help with performance (e.g. 3 or 4 number of articles)\r\n  - for now, we'll try it out with these initial limits and see what the performance is\r\n- is this a new component?\r\n  - yes\r\n  - it requires configuration & we need to decide how much control to give publishers\r\n  - it also has some configurable default UI associated with it (e.g. possibly cards-based approach when you have multiple articles, collapsing dots)\r\n  - John: based on experience, if we get too prescriptive about the UI a lot of publishers will push back on it\r\n- is this a component provided by a third-party recommendation provider?\r\n  - they could provide configuration for the behavior\r\n- name\r\n  - amp-content-discovery is proposal, but should it be something like amp-article-infinite-scroll?\r\n  - people aren't just going to use it for content discovery\r\n  - \"chain\" would potentially be better\r\n  - people may be confused between amp-list and this component when they are creating AMP pages, name can help with that\r\n  - name will be discussed offline",
