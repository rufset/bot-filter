  "body": "Thanks for starting this discussion.\r\n\r\nTo recap, The 10.0 LTS release broke us because we pinned our project's `package.json` to the latest major LTS version (`^8.0.0`). This was okay when there was just one active LTS, although it still needed us to manually update the currently allowed version.\r\n\r\nTo fix this, the plan (after discussing with others) is to enable node version updates from Renovate using `\"supportPolicy\": [\"lts_active\"]` (https://renovatebot.com/docs/node/). This will allow us to use any one of the active LTS versions of node for local development, while using the latest active LTS for testing on Travis.\r\n\r\nEdit: We'd also need to revert the version specified in `.travis.yml` to `lts/*`. This is being done in # #19234",
