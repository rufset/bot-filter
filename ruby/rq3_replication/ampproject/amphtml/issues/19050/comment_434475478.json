  "body": "A few notes to help start the conversation:\r\n\r\n**We agreed to use the latest LTS version of Node to avoid supporting multiple Node.js releases with features that may or may not be compatible with transpilation.**\r\n\r\nSome of the initial motivation regarded the use of `async/await`, which was fully supported with the Carbon (8.x) branch of Node.js but unsupported in Boron (6.x). Both of these versions were active LTS at the same time, which meant we would need to compile our build system Node scripts using `async/await` or wait until April 2019 to start using the newer syntax officially supported starting October 2017.\r\n\r\n**Simultaneous LTS branches will be the new normal.**\r\n\r\nThis issue will continue to impact projects like AMP while there are several active LTS branches of Node. There are three active LTS branches with Dubnium entering active LTS support today. If we choose to support multiple LTS branches we will need to ensure all build system code complies with the lowest supported LTS version.\r\n\r\n![screen shot 2018-10-30 at 2 08 32 pm](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61764/47751433-f9203f00-dc4e-11e8-9213-155c51d70ccc.png)\r\n\r\nAccording to the [schedule](https://github.com/nodejs/Release), there will be three active LTS branches from now until at least April 2022.\r\n\r\n**New LTS Releases can cause instability in the Project**\r\n\r\n* Since we do not pro-actively test with newer versions of Node.js, it's possible an LTS release will cause the CI/CD pipeline to fall over.\r\n\r\n* Developers working on the project will be forced to upgrade at LTS release time, not on a schedule communicated by the AMP team.\r\n\r\n* Releases can be delayed if `nvm` doesn't detect the correct version when a LTS release occurs.",
