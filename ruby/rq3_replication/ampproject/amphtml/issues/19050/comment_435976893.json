  "body": "The issue with pinning to an exact version is delayed upgrades via manual enforcement. Although infrequent (~ once a year), the delay in upgrading can be removed entirely by using `lts/*`.\r\n\r\nDownsides:\r\n1. Version changes automatically, without notice, for all developers.\r\n2. Uncertainty regarding stability of `lts/*`, since codebase isn't tested before the `lts` release is required for all developers. (*note*: this is an issue needing resolution independently)\r\n\r\nUpsides:\r\n1. No manual effort to move Node versions\r\n2. Can use the latest V8 features (and Node APIs) with confidence to make our build system code more readable, testable, and performant.",
