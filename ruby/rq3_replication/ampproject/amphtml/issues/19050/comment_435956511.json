  "body": "It sounds like what we need to do is change the requirement from LTS to a major version number.  The version we select should always be in the LTS window and when a new LTS is available we should test it in the CI/CD chain and make a change to the tooling requirement on our schedule (but always before the current version EOL).\r\n\r\nThis still means devs have to update their toolchain so @torch2424's point about dev workload is still valid (although only once a year).  That's unavoidable as we'll always need to deprecate node versions as they fall out of their maintenance window.",
