  "body": "> Would this mean that Travis would not test against older (but still active) LTS releases?\r\n\r\nCorrect. As configured today, Travis will only test against the latest active LTS.\r\n\r\nIn order to run all tests on Travis against the latest LTS, we'd need to double our VM usage. The argument could be made for merely making sure the runtime builds correctly on older active LTS version(s), but I'm not sure if that's a large enough benefit, given that we expect a subset of development to be done using those versions.",
