  "body": "@cramforce @erwinmombay `greenkeeper` and `greenkeeper-lockfile` are now enabled and active for ampproject/amphtml. See https://account.greenkeeper.io/account/ampproject\r\n\r\nWe're currently using a `GH_TOKEN` with only `public_repo` access. Now, it's wait and watch until the next dependency gets updated, at which point we should expect an automatically generated PR that updates `package.json` and `yarn.lock`.\r\n\r\nWe can close this bug once that happens, and we're satisfied that all went well.\r\n  ",
