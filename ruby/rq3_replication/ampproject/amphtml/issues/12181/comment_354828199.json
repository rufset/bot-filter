  "body": "@cramforce @erwinmombay The final task before I can close out this issue is to install `greenkeeper` and `greenkeeper-lockfile` for `github.com/ampproject/amphtml`. Since I lack the access rights to do so, could I bug one of you to help with the install / setup, or ask you to (temporarily) give me access?\r\n\r\nEdit: Installation links:\r\nhttps://github.com/integration/greenkeeper\r\nhttps://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper-lockfile",
