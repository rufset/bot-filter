  "body": "@cramforce @erwinmombay See the section titled \"Github Integrations\" at https://blog.greenkeeper.io/greenkeeper-2-0-release-da8f8f476c88\r\n\r\nIt appears that Greenkeeper only needs access to our metadata files (`package.json`, `.travis.yml`, and likely `yarn.lock`). I wonder if we can restrict access to just those files via the Github Integrations API (https://github.com/blog/2226-build-an-integration-for-github)",
