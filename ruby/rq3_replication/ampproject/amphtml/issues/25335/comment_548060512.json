  "body": "Hi @Robdel12, thanks for the quick fix! We got a `renovate-bot` PR (#25334) to fix this, and your PR removes the `PERCY_PROJECT` variables (which we don't use anymore as you correctly stated) but it leaves a few more references to it (there are some places where it's `percy_project`, in lower-case) - do you want to push another commit to this or should I merge the other PR and remove that dangling env variable in a separate PR? :)",
