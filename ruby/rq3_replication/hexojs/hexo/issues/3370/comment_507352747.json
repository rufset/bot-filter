  "body": "1/ in general, I would not use yarn.lock, but package-lock json. yarn.lock is \"deprecated in favor of the other\r\n\r\n2/ In general, I would not use package-lock.json in any plugin. Each hexo user can decide or not to use a lock file on it's own repo, to have reproductible builds over time\r\n\r\n3/ In some rare cases, temporarily, we could commit lock file to be able to fix known vulnerabilities using npm audit --fix, which I did, in some repos\r\n\r\n4/ hexo-cli is a special case where it is not possible for the user to decide or not to use the lock file. In that case, it is possible that a dependency update breaks the package, and thus the ci of all hexo users. It occurred few months ago\r\n\r\n5/ in any cases, the different cases should be advertized to inform user of the expected behavior",
