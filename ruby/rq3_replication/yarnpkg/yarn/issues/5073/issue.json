  "title": "Feature request: Use Renovate for maintaining dependencies in yarnpkg/yarn repository",
  "body": "I would like to propose the Yarn team consider [Renovate](https://github.com/renovateapp/renovate) for automated dependency updates. It's an open source tool available to run either self-hosted (`yarn global add renovate`) or via a [GitHub App](https://github.com/apps/renovate) that I run for free. The GitHub App supports currently 1000+ projects and already creates hundreds of PRs daily. Installed organizations include [GoogleChromeLabs](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs), [mozilla](https://github.com/mozilla), [webcomponents](https://github.com/webcomponents), [algolia](https://github.com/algolia) and [apollographql](https://github.com/apollographql).\r\n\r\nRenovate has these capabilities which would benefit Yarn:\r\n\r\n- Keeps dependencies in `package.json` files up-to-date with latest versions via Pull Requests\r\n- Extensive configuration/customisation support via JSON configuration file\r\n- Renovate generates its own `yarn.lock` files with the same commit as the related `package.json` files, including for Yarn Workspaces\r\n- Renovate PRs get immediately rebased or regenerated to resolve any git conflicts, such as in `package.json` or `yarn.lock`\r\n- Renovate can be used to regularly \"maintain\" `yarn.lock` files in a repository. e.g. regenerate them daily or weekly and submit the changes via PR. \r\n- Known monorepos (e.g. react, babel, etc) are automatically configured to group sibling packages together into one PR\r\n- Custom grouping can be defined to group related dependencies into the same PR to reduce total number of PRs\r\n- Scheduling rules can be used to help tame the PR firehose, e.g. limit to certain hours of the day, or weekends only, or monthly, or whatever. *Example: configure all `eslint` and related packages to update monthly in a single PR, rather than in real-time*.\r\n- Possible to customise templates for PR title, commit message, semantic commit prefix, etc - Renovate can fit into your conventions \r\n- Renovate App signs all its git commits\r\n\r\nI am the author of Renovate and watch the app logs diligently via monitoring, so would also volunteer to triage Yarn's dependency updates too. e.g. looking at any failed Renovate branches to determine if the upstream dependency made a backwards-incompatible change or mistake, or if Yarn needs to update its implementation, etc. ",
