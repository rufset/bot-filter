  "body": "I've forked and verified that Renovate runs smoothly on the Yarn source code. I think the best approach is to keep it as minimal impact as possible to begin with, and I can then later make suggestions for ideas to improve workflow (e.g. pinning lint packages so builds don't break from in-range updates).\r\n\r\nI therefore recommend this simple Renovate config:\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"extends\": [\r\n    \"config:base\",\r\n    \":preserveSemverRanges\"\r\n  ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is the default Renovate base settings + one rule which says \"Keep using the same type of semver ranges as already exist\", i.e. no dependency pinning yet.\r\n\r\nSteps:\r\n\r\n- [x] Merge my PR #5175 (I think two of your dependencies have been set to exact versions rather than ranges by accident, so merging this will make things cleaner/more consistent)\r\n- [x] Someone with admin rights goes to https://github.com/apps/renovate and installs Renovate for this repository\r\n- [x] Renovate will soon after raise a \"Configure Renovate\" PR for onboarding\r\n- [ ] Update the default `renovate.json` config to match what I wrote above\r\n- [ ] Merge the PR (i.e. add the `renovate.json` to the repository)\r\n- [ ] Renovate will then begin raising dependency update PRs\r\n\r\nYou can expect to receive [16 PRs](https://github.com/renovate-tests/yarn/pulls) (13 major version upgrades and three 0.x range bumps) after the last step. \r\n\r\nAny of those upgrades can also be \"dismissed\" by simply closing the respective PR. Renovate will then add a comment to the PR noting that it is ignoring that major version and won't suggest it again.",
