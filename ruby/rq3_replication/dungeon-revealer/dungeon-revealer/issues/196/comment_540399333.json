  "body": "> My concern is mainly that when people view my GitHub profile, I'd prefer they at least see a link to the organization prominently, if possible, rather than an old version of the code as my personal repository. Maybe that's not possible, and if not then I'm fine to migrate to an organization.\r\n\r\n@apclary You can pin a project from an organization to your profile (Click Customize your pins, e.g. I pinned react-native-community/react-native-camera) and you can set your organization membership status to \"public\", so you have a shiny icon below your profile (check my profile: https://github.com/n1ru4l).\r\n\r\nInstead of adding I new repo on the organization I would recommend moving this one over there, that way the old URL (https://github.com/apclary/dungeon-revealer) will automatically redirect to the new URL.\r\n\r\n\r\nFurthermore, I did not receive an invitation invite üòê. Dunno whether this is an issue with Github, did not receive an email either.",
