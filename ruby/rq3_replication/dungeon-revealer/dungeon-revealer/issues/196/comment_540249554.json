  "body": "Thanks, I've created an organization called dungeon-revealer and invited you to it. I also added renovate to this project (in the sense that I connected it to the repo, I made no code changes). \r\n\r\nI think an organization makes sense for the future, especially as you've taken such a lead on the development efforts and your specialization seems to be more in line with the front end with DR mostly entails. My concern is mainly that when people view my GitHub profile, I'd prefer they at least see a link to the organization prominently, if possible, rather than an old version of the code as my personal repository. Maybe that's not possible, and if not then I'm fine to migrate to an organization.\r\n\r\nI imagine we'd want to migrate over the other contributions to this organization as well. I'm attempting to migrate the repo from my personal account to the org account now.\r\n\r\nLet me know what you think or what specific actions you'd like me to take. ",
