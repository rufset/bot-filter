  "title": "use renovate instead of depfu for pinning dependencies",
  "body": "@apclary Overall renovate has a better DX then depfu:\r\n\r\n- The config file is located inside repository (so I can do adjustments without bothering you to tweak the depfu configuration which is webinterface and repo-owner only)\r\n- batches mono-repo updates (like react & react-dom)\r\n\r\nTherefore I would recommend removing depfu and adding the renovate integration (which is free for Open Source). You can add renovate here: https://github.com/marketplace/renovate/plan/\r\n\r\nDespite that, we could still move dungeon-revealer to a Github organization (which is free for Open Source) and would allow other contributors (like me) to do administration stuff.",
