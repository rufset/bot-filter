  "title": "Suggestion / request: use Dependabot to keep dependencies up-to-date",
  "body": "First of all, thanks for Cachet!\r\n\r\nI've got a suggestion / request: would you be up for using [Dependabot](https://dependabot.com) to automatically create dependency update PRs for this Cachet? I ran it against my fork and it generated [these PRs](https://github.com/greysteil/Cachet/pulls). I'll port the `zendframework/zend-diactoros` PR over to this repo now.\r\n\r\nI built Dependabot, but I'm honestly only suggesting it because I hope it can save you some time. I'd love any feedback, and obviously having a repo like Cachet using Dependabot would help boost its profile, but if it's not helpful to you then it's not really worth anything.\r\n\r\nYou can install it from [here](https://github.com/apps/dependabot) or [here](https://github.com/marketplace/dependabot) if you decide to give it a try. üôè ",
