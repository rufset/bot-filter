  "body": "@LinusU thanks update packages!\r\n\r\nTests failed on Windows is not caused by ShellJS.\r\nIt's just a problem with changing working directory(even if not via ShellJS) for exec some command(`git`, `npm`) in temporally directory for tests.\r\n\r\nCould you approve above fix(`sh.cd(__dirname)`, `npx yarn add`(yarn is locally installed at test))?\r\nIf so, I'll create a PR and test non-Windows platforms as well.",
