  "body": "Thanks for considering this! \r\n\r\nRight now in cases when we want to use the latest & greatest version of some packages, but it's hard to update entire repo due to large amount of breaking changes, we just resort to [yarn aliased packages](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/cli/add/#toc-yarn-add-alias) and end up with dependencies like `\"hapi-latest\": \"npm:hapi@17.5.0\"` (3 major versions behind) and `\"lodash-latest\": \"npm:lodash@4.17.10\"` (one major behind) accompanied by `@types/*-latest` packages. It allows us to gradually migrate code to the latest library and eventually switch `something-latest` to `something`, but may significantly increase the size of distributable packages.\r\n\r\nMaybe there is a better interim solution for that?\r\n\r\n/cc @weltenwort ",
