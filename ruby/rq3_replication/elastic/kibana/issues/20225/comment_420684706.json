  "body": "Heya, Team Greenkeeper here and big Kibana fan (ðŸ‘‹). Let us know if there is anything specific we can help with.\r\n\r\nFor now, Greenkeeper supports [ignoring dependencies](https://greenkeeper.io/docs.html#ignoring-dependencies) that you know you donâ€™t wanna touch for the moment. That allows you to ease into usage with only the things you can manage. And then *after* you get on top of everything, including the big ticket items, you benefit from finding security issues even faster.\r\n\r\nIn addition, if you pin your deps and Greenkeeper opens an issue notifying you about a major new version, you can just close and ignore that issue.\r\n\r\nIf there is anything else that might be useful, do feel free to reach out any time: support@greenkeeper.io",
