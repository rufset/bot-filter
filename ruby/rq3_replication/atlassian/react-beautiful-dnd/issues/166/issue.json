  "title": "Move to fuzzy dependency versions",
  "body": "The package.json pins down dependencies pretty hard. This leads to duplicate dependencies in our project, e.g. `prop-types` which already has newer releases. Would you consider to updating all dependencies with carets `^` or at least tildes `~`? Or is there any reason why pinning them down, if you rely on yarn anyway.\r\n\r\nPS: I see that you have travis-ci in place, you could think about adding [greenkeeper](https://greenkeeper.io/) as well to update dependencies automatically and report breakages with newer versions of this package.",
