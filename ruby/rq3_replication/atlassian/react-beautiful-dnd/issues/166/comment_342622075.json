  "body": "Hi @leipert.\r\nI will ask around if there are any potential implications of moving to fuzzy dependencies. Keeping the dependencies locked adds a large level of confidence as we can test all the code exactly as it will be given to users. Even if we lock the dependencies in the lock file it seems like you would like to use dependencies that are not the exact same version as would be in the lock file - rather moving to a fuzzy range. Adding a fuzzy range potentially introduces bugs if dependencies break in minor or patch versions. I would hope that the dependencies of the library are light enough that this would not really be an issue anyway. \r\n\r\nRegarding `prop-types`. I am actually thinking of removing them altogether and just leaning on flow to reduce overhead. Also, this dependency should move to ~0kb in production if you set up your build correctly. That is my understanding anyway. Please let me know if that is not the case\r\n\r\nRegarding greenkeeper - it is awesome and I want to use it. Sadly we have had issues with latest dependencies not working together well. That was about two months ago so I might try to push to latest of everything soon. If we can get to latest then yes a tool like greenkeeper would be useful #37 ",
