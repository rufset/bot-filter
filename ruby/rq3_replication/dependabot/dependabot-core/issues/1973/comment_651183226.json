  "body": "@infin8x I understnd the security concerns and wanting to make this something we have to do intentionally, but I haven't found a bot that can distinguish the pacakge name and semver bump before merging. If this isn't going to be supported in dependabot directly is there a way to add labels based on names and semver?\r\n\r\nAn example of our current config:\r\n```\r\nautomerged_updates:\r\n    - match:\r\n        dependency_name: \"eslint\"\r\n    - match:\r\n        update_type: \"semver:minor\"\r\n        dependency_name: \"@fortawesome/free-brands-svg-icons\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe don't want to automerge everything (or even most things) so automerging based on a label applied to every update doesn't work, we'd need to be able to label based on the same criteria we used to auto merge with.\r\n",
