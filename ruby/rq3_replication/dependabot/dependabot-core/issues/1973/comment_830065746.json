  "body": "That's really a sad move from Dependabot even if I understand the arguments for and against the auto-merging removal.\r\n\r\nAt work we have more than 200 repositories (with a lot of private ones) and we **can not check** ALL Dependabot pull requests accross all of them. \r\nThe auto-merging feature is so much useful that we literally can't think working without it:\r\n- it saves us a lot of times\r\n- we configured Dependabot to merge patch and minor updates, meaning we can take benefits of fixed bugs or improved perfs (but of course it can also comes vulnerability issues, but since we only have web projects we _don't really care_ (don't hit me üòù )) \r\n\r\nOf course there are many tools that can automatically merge (and auto-approve if needed), like Kodiak, but to be honest I found it hard to understand and use. Also I'm not a big fan to delegate auto-approving/auto-merging to a third-party tool, where Dependabot (**owned by GitHub**) did the job perfectly before. \r\n\r\nI can 100% trust Dependabot, which is not the case for third-party tools. I don't say they are bad and can't be trusted, I'm an open-source contributor and really like open-source, but that's not an official GitHub feature.\r\n\r\n~As a workaround, I've created a GitHub action that fits our needs https://github.com/Yproximite/auto-approve-and-merge-dependabot-action:~ \r\n- ~check it's a PR from a dependabot~\r\n- ~check update type (thanks to https://github.com/dependabot/dependabot-core/issues/1973#issuecomment-675808510)~\r\n- ~approve and merge if the update type is allowed to be merged~\r\n\r\n**EDIT:** prefer using https://github.com/ahmadnassri/action-dependabot-auto-merge which do the same things but better! :D \r\n\r\nIt does the job (even if sometimes I got random 403 error from GitHub API), but that's definitly not ideal. üòû \r\n\r\nWon't it be possible to keep auto-merging feature but make it disabled by default?\r\n\r\n**EDIT 2:** See https://hugo.alliau.me/2021/05/04/migration-to-github-native-dependabot-solutions-for-auto-merge-and-action-secrets/ for a working example of auto-approve and auto-merge.",
