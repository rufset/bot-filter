It's clearly something that a lot of people really valued from the old dependabot, and not all projects/workflows are affected by the risk equally (not everyone autodeploys the main branch and may do a dependency check before manually kicking off a release, libraries still require a manual release etc), but at the same time the potential risk for massively rolling out a malicious update are scary.",
