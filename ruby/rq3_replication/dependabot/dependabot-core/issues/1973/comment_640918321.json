  "body": "Thanks for the feedback and sorry for the confusion here.\r\n\r\nAuto-merge will not be supported in GitHub-native Dependabot for the foreseeable future. We know some of you have built great workflows that rely on auto-merge, but right now, weâ€™re concerned about auto-merge being used to quickly propagate a malicious package across the ecosystem. We recommend always verifying your dependencies before merging them.",
