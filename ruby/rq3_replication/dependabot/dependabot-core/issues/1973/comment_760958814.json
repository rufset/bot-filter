  "body": "What would it take for this decision to be reconsidered?\r\n\r\nThe way I see, the security protection here is: updates will roll out slowly, so if it's malicious, it won't affect too many projects. Looks like this is only really slowing the whole process. I understand that as a temporary solution, but I'd expect something else to happen in the *short term future*.\r\n\r\nI also don't expect a manual review to catch a security issue, unless it is a very known issue and you're specifically looking for it. I can't keep them all in my head and I don't want to go over every dependency update. We get hundreds of those per day. I expect that people will configure auto merge anyway (with fewer features, because now we can't enable it only for minor versions), or simply do them manually, but blindly.",
