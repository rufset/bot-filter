  "body": "I'm probably one of these potential users that \"would use automerge but are not participating in this thread\". I don't have any background in IT, and only maintaining a few smaller projects in my freetime. If I get a dependabot PR and the checks are green, I often just click merge without even looking at the changed files. Sometimes, if time permits, I skim over the changelog. Today was the first time I read about \"chain of supply attacks\".\r\n\r\nThat being said, \r\n> For those of you who have vetted your supply chain or are willing to accept the risks, the \"opt-in\" solutions exist. There are a plethora of apps (e.g. kodiak), Actions (e.g. merge-me), other products (e.g. renovate), a cron job that just runs npm update every day, etc.\r\n\r\nThis just feels like security by obscurity to me. So far, I was using an auto-merge action and while implementing it I was a bit annoyed that it's so complicated, but never thought about security concerns. That's probably also the case for many other developers that just want the feature and that not think about why it is not provided out of the box. In my opinion, it would create a much better awareness, if dependabot has a \"automerge: true\" feature and the documentation would discuss pro and cons of using it. Maybe couple it to an option \"allow-unsafe-operations: true\" or something, to make it really clear!\r\n\r\n",
