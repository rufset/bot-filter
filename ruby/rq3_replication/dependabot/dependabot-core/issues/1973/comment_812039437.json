  "body": "Re: @sehenst\r\n> Would it be possible to add support for auto-merge if the dependency is an internal organization package?\r\n\r\nThis is one of the few situations that we think it's less-insecure to use auto-merge. I do think it's a little tough to know what \"internal\" packages are (e.g. is any private registry/repo considered internal? What if it's just mirroring a public registry?), so I doubt that we'll build it directly in, but instead recommend folks use an Action or a standalone app configured according to their security/risk profile. I'm working on some docs to help folks with this.\r\n\r\nSide note, _infin8x is no longer working on Dependabot, so he's probably not going to be responding.",
