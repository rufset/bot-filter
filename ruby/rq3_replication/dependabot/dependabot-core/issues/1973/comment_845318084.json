  "body": "Thanks @asciimike for your genuine curiosity and empathy in presenting the reasoning in public here, knowing that a great many users and customers will see this as very bad news. We still appreciate you! ❤️ \r\n\r\nAs Github Team customers, however, I do think it's important to clarify that we consider having a narrow, security-maximizing native support for auto-merging to be vital. For example, an auto-merge dependabot feature that narrowly allows only:\r\n-  **allow-listed** dependencies\r\n- **passed** all CI tests\r\n- **semver patch** version change\r\n- with **no change of control** over the dependency (if possible)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nQ: Is it clear why we are seeing this feature gap as squarely in the middle of the target for the \"[Github Advanced Security](https://github.com/features/security)\" product value?\r\n\r\nFor reference, this text is from the doc \"Github Enterprise Grade Security and Compliance\":\r\n> **Dependabot & Automated Security Fixes (Beta)**\r\n>\r\n> Automated maintance [sic] of vulnerable and out of date\r\ndependencies\r\n>\r\n> • Automated pull requests with changelogs, commits,\r\nand compatiblity [sic] scores for outdated dependencies\r\n>\r\n> • Resolve vulnerabilities using an automated\r\nsecurity fix in a pull request that corresponds to\r\nsecurity alerts\r\n\r\nWe do see this feature advocated heavily towards our organization as a reason to upgrade to GHE -- does that framing make sense?",
