  "body": "I've helped maintain a number of both popular and not-so-popular OSS projects, and while I understand the convenience, I also think Github is making a wise choice here. \r\n\r\nSupply chain attacks are already happening and they are only going to increase in the future. \r\n\r\nIf you really want auto-merge, either setup a GitHub action, or spin up your own copy of dependabot, or switch to renovate, or simply lower the frequency so that you can handle updates as a weekly task. \r\nIMO handling updates with a few manual clicks on PR's is trivial and takes less than 30 seconds for me most of the time.",
