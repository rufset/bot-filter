  "body": "Thanks for this @asciimike! In principle, it seems as though the direction you outlined above would work in a \"roll your own\" fashion ðŸš€ \r\n\r\n_Crucially: the proposal above does not require trusting third-party actions!_\r\n\r\nI wonder if there is perhaps a PM we should be in touch with, in terms of understanding how we see this product feature interacting with messaging we are receiving around the product? I'm not hearing the **centrality of this feature to the product offering** being acknowledged in this thread, perhaps I missed it?\r\n\r\nMay I ask that our kind friends at Github also review how the [Supply Chain Security](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/supply-chain-security/keeping-your-dependencies-updated-automatically) is actually being marketed to clients like us? It still seems to me that there may be a disconnect between the outward-facing messaging from Github, vs the content of this thread.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\nhttps://docs.github.com/en/code-security/supply-chain-security/keeping-your-dependencies-updated-automatically\r\n> **Enabling and disabling version updates**\r\n>\r\n> You can configure your repository so that Dependabot automatically updates the packages you use.\r\n\r\nThanks again!",
