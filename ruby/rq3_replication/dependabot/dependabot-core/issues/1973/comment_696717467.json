  "body": "> In our org we have automerge setup for when branch conditions are met.\r\n> And we always require review, we like just being able to approve a PR and then it automatically merges.\r\n> \r\n> It saves a few clicks in the UI and also means that if CI is retriggered it will merge after CI is green.\r\n> \r\n> Saves have to type `@dependabot merge` which isn't too bad but would be nice to get automerge back\r\n\r\nThat makes me wonder if you could setup a GHA to auto comment `@dependabot merge` when a PR is approved in review. Doesn't solve people wanting unattended auto-merge, but might solve your use case.",
