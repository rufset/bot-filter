You don't trust me to make good choices for my own application. Automerge was already opt in so there is no risk that I could enable this feature accidentally and the \"folks who are not in this thread\" you're worried about would also have to opt-in to that behavior. The entire argument from the Github side is that developers cannot be trusted to make good security tradeoff decisions and so you have stepped in to save us. I asked for more labels almost a year ago in #2294, that is a possible solution that may help with this. More improvements to the new `Enable Auto Merge` option in the PR UI will also help. At the end of the day though I'm going to have to cobble together a solution that you could continue to provide, but are refusing to.",
