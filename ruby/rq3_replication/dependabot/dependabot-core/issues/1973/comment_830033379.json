  "body": "I used the dependabot auto-merge feature for a long while and was sad when it went away. My workaround is to schedule all of the dependabot updates for Tuesday mornings, and copy/paste `@dependabot merge` between GitHub email notifications. I don't mind this so much.\r\n\r\nMy hunch would be: _the majority of maintainers don't review every line of change in their dependencies_. At most, they look at the release notes. So, really the difference is:\r\n\r\n1. Life before dependabot: dependencies rarely were updated.\r\n2. Life with dependabot: dependencies are semi-regularly updated.\r\n\r\nThis hypothesis could be validated with a survey and some data analysis.\r\n\r\nIf this were true, it almost presents an argument in @asciimike's favor: longer delays in updating dependencies makes a supply-chain attack is less acute.\r\n\r\nUltimately, it's tough because official support for auto-merging dependencies presents a huge ball of liability for GitHub. This liability exists because open source is really only a web of trust. Auto-merging dependencies would allow a nefarious actor to violate the trust faster, more severely, etc.",
