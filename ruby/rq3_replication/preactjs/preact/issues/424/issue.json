  "body": "Currently we are running Sauce Labs on **pushes** to all branches. PRs are not included as of #390.\r\n\r\nThat is OK and working fine for PRs and pushes to `master`.\r\n\r\nAfter checking the Greenkeeper behavior, I noticed that it pushes it's changes to a newly created local branch and then it creates a PR to `master`.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that it ends up starting two Travis jobs, one using Sauce Labs (push to branch) and one using local Chrome (PR). Since Sauce Labs connection can be flakey, it may not be ideal to use it to check dependency updates or even simple branch experiments.\r\n\r\nI believe that we should only keep Sauce on for pushes to the `master` branch.\r\n\r\nThis seems right because the widget on README is related to `master` as well.\r\n\r\nThe question now is: how do we want to handle `beta`? Should we test it on Sauce Labs too or wait until it arrives on `master`?",
