  "body": "This is, ironically, going to require an update from [update-notifier](https://github.com/yeoman/update-notifier/). configstore already has a release that depends on dot-prop 5.2.0, but update-notifier hasn't been updated in a while. I'm going to close this, because dependabot will ensure we update once it's available. You might want to open an issue on the update-notifier repo, as it doesn't seem like anyone has. In the meantime you can use yarn resolutions in your own site, or one of the hacks that does similar for npm.",
