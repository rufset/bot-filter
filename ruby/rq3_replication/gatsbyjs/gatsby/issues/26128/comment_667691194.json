  "body": "It is a fix by forcing dot-prop to a higher version but it _can_ introduce issues if the consuming library isn't prepared for a later version.\r\n\r\nWith that said, for `dot-prop` I don't think you'll have any issues with forcing a higher version. Also you shouldn't need to wildcard it. I think the following will work better;\r\n\r\n`\"resolutions\": { \"dot-prop\": \">=5.2.0\" }`",
