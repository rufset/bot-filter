  "body": "I spent 2 days on this issue and here's how I finally found salvation\r\n* I switched to yarn - did nothing\r\n* I cleared node_modules rand gatsby clean did nothing\r\n* I was having issues with node so I reverted from node 12 to node 10 (that fixed another issue I was having)\r\n\r\n`$ npm i node@10.15.3 -g`\r\n\r\n* I did $ npm rebuild (did nothing)\r\n* I was desperate and tried audit fix (did nothing)\r\n* I uninstalled gatsby-plugin-favicon (did nothing - so reinstalled it)\r\n\r\nThen I had **GLib GObject-CRITICAL errors** and I checked for different versions of sharp\r\nusing\r\n\r\n`$ npm up`\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\n`$ npm ls sharp`\r\n\r\n* I downgraded gatsby-plugin-sharp (did nothing)\r\n\r\nIn the end I believe from my google searching that the issue resides with different versions of sharp\r\n\r\n![before](https://i.imgur.com/VQ3T6wM.png)\r\n\r\n* And that will show that sharp versions are off\r\n\r\nI looked at the gatsby-transformer-sharp and it's version was off so I saw in the [repo](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/blob/master/packages/gatsby-transformer-sharp/package.json) that it has the correct version of sharp but my gatsby-transformer-sharp was an older version. I upgraded to\r\n\r\n`$ npm i gatsby-transformer-sharp@2.3.2`\r\n\r\n* ANd now I get\r\n\r\n![new sharps are matching up](https://i.imgur.com/4UfsDbY.png)\r\n\r\n* Now I ran `$ gatsby develop` and life was great again. Hope this helps other Gatsby JS shipmates to avoid code sea sickness. Ahoy!",
