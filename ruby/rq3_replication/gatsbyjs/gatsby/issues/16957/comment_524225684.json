  "body": "> The cannot register existing type 'VipsObject' message suggests two different versions of the libvips shared libraries are being used in the same node process, which might suggest that both sharp v0.22.x and v0.23.x are in the dependency tree.\r\n\r\n@lovell Hope all is well with you and thank you for the quick response. \r\n\r\nOpened a new issue in https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/issues/16985 to track this so we can improve the experience for the next time vips is upgraded. We do some handling in https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/blob/master/packages/gatsby-plugin-sharp/src/safe-sharp.js but need to handle this edge case as well I think. \r\n\r\nThanks everyone!",
