  "body": "well that's unfortunate that favicons still seems stuck on an old sharp.\r\nperhaps it's down to the semver upgrade\r\nfunnily enough I have favicons working in my project, but without that dependency.\r\n\r\nAs far as I can tell it's a very deep problem to have two versions of sharp co-existing. We're dependent on the packages updating to use the same sub-deps of sharp.\r\n\r\nalso FWIW I stopped using yarn because of various problems with C extensions and native compiling. npm also has a cache now so i think the speed difference isn't so noticeable.\r\n\r\nI just installed latest favicons and indeed get that same problem.\r\n\r\n```\r\n➜  dc.rik.ai git:(master) ✗ yarn list --pattern sharp\r\nyarn list v1.17.3\r\n├─ favicons@5.4.1\r\n│  └─ sharp@0.22.1\r\n├─ gatsby-plugin-sharp@2.2.27\r\n├─ gatsby-transformer-sharp@2.2.19\r\n└─ sharp@0.23.1\r\n✨  Done in 8.55s.\r\n```\r\n\r\nmy app will still start but I guess it's because of the image cache or sharp not getting triggered.\r\n\r\n```\r\n➜  dc.rik.ai git:(master) ✗ rm -rf .cache\r\n➜  dc.rik.ai git:(master) ✗ npm start\r\n```\r\n\r\nhowever still starts... so it's hard to even know how to trigger this nasty problem.\r\nprobably running the whole install process again.\r\n\r\nfrom my side I just removed the favicons package for now, as I seem to have favicons anyway.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
