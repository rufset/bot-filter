  "body": "The `cannot register existing type 'VipsObject'` message suggests two different versions of the libvips shared libraries are being used in the same `node` process, which might suggest that both sharp v0.22.x and v0.23.x are in the dependency tree.\r\n\r\nIf so, please see https://github.com/lovell/sharp/issues/1680#issuecomment-487701749 for some previous advice on how Gatsby might be able to manage this.",
