  "body": "Hi guys!\r\n\r\n@greysteil sure, we stopped using Depfu because it does not automatically update the Gemfile with the specific version for minor gem upgrades. We prefer to have the exact version specified in the Gemfile, not only in the Gemfile.lock\r\n\r\n@PierreMesure thanks for all those PRs, merging üéâ \r\n\r\n@viren140290 right, there is a big PR coming with Rails 5 and many gem dependency updates, but we still got quite a bit of real life testing to do before merging. Feel free to update any gem in the meantime üëç ",
