  "body": "Yeah, I agree with that - seems odd for you to be curating this list.\r\n\r\nThe only place with an organisation curating this that I'm aware of is the dependency management section of the GitHub Marketplace, [filtered for Python](https://github.com/marketplace/category/dependency-management?utf8=%E2%9C%93&query=python). The downside is that that doesn't (yet) have pyup.io on it, but the upside is it would shift these requests to GitHub and away from PyPI.\r\n\r\n**Update:** Even better might be [this link](https://github.com/works-with/category/dependency-management?utf8=%E2%9C%93&query=python), which has all the apps that work with GitHub on it (a lower bar than getting into the marketplace) so includes pyup ðŸŽ‰ ",
