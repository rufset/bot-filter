  "body": "I'd like to voice my strong objection to pinning anything, unless\nabsolutely necessary.\n\nMy main concern is security. My secondary concern are bugfixes.\n\nnpm will yell rather often if any of the packages would get a\nvulnerability. We are not using npm packages which pin their dependencies,\nthat's our security policy. We'd have to drop using Agenda if this PR gets\nmerged.\n\nPlease, let's not pin production dependencies. Dev dependencies are OK to\nbe pinned, but I'd not recommend doing it either, since it occasionally\nbrings more maintenance efforts.\n\n\n\nOn Sat, 17 Oct 2020, 08:12 Alexis Tyler, <notifications@github.com> wrote:\n\n> Pinning allows us to ensure we’re using the same versions when testing.\n> Since we plan on having dependabot keep things up to date pinning is fine.\n>\n> —\n> You are receiving this because your review was requested.\n> Reply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\n> <https://github.com/agenda/agenda/pull/1132#issuecomment-710641242>, or\n> unsubscribe\n> <https://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/AAMMEL4H44JETLFDSAPJ5ATSLCZKPANCNFSM4SRW7O6Q>\n> .\n>\n",
