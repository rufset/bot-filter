  "body": "Huh! I am more impressed with dependabot than I expected.\r\n\r\nIt's true that it doesn't support batching unrelated updates together, though apparently it's on the roadmap: https://github.com/dependabot/feedback/issues/185\r\n\r\nHowever, it *can* handle updates like ipython 6.5 â†’ 7.0. Check out this PR it generated, which not only bumps the dependencies like prompt-toolkit, but also drops some now-unnecessary dependencies: https://github.com/python-trio/trio/pull/690/files\r\n\r\nApparently that's because it actually understands pip-compile: https://dependabot.com/blog/dependabot-now-supports-pip-compile/\r\n\r\nAlso interesting: when I manually bumped yapf (#694), dependabot noticed and automatically closed its PR (https://github.com/python-trio/trio/pull/689#issuecomment-425299024). pyup didn't notice, so now I'm not sure how to fix its batched PR (#688).\r\n\r\nThe in-github commands are also kind of impressive, e.g. if a dependency does a broken release and we want to wait for the next release instead of working around it, you can `@dependabot ignore this minor version` to tell it to wait for the next release.",
