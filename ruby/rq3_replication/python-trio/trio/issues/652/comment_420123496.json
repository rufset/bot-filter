  "body": "[Hypothesis has been using pyup.io](https://github.com/HypothesisWorks/hypothesis/blob/master/.pyup.yml) for about a year now, and it's been fantastic - just set it to weekly PRs (per linked config).  It turns out that this insulates us a bit from breakage too, because many problems are fixed by a quick patch release by upstream before the update PR is opened ðŸ˜„ \r\n\r\nThen either we confine CI breakage to that single PR where it can be fixed, or the first maintainer to see it can click merge.",
