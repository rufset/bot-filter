  "body": "Update: renovate looks great on paper, but it just... doesn't work. We've had stale pins for days, and it's not sending PRs for them. Also see #687. So I've just disabled it.\r\n\r\nI tried setting up requires.io to try, but (a) it was really confusing, (b) now that I finally seem to have everything set up, it doesn't seem to be sending an initial PR? Maybe that's intentional, because it's edge-triggered by releases rather than being level-triggered by dependencies being out of date? Still, not very helpful. Basically zero configurability, too. I guess I'll give up on this.\r\n\r\nI guess there's also dependabot? Apparently I turned that on a few weeks ago too and it just never did anything.\r\n\r\nI just turned on pyup.io, and it immediately took the lead over the other options by sending a PR (!), that updated our dependencies (!!) (#688).",
