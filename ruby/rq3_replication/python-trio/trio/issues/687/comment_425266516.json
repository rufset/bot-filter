  "body": "Oh, I see:\r\n\r\n```\r\nipython 7.0.1 has requirement prompt-toolkit<2.1.0,>=2.0.0, but you'll have prompt-toolkit 1.0.15 which is incompatible.\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo the problem is that renovate is only updating the ipython pin, but not the pins for the projects it depends on. Which is weird. why isn't it updating those pins?\r\n\r\nAnyone know if pyup or requires.io handle this better?",
