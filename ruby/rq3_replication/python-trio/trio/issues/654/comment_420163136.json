  "body": "Yeah, what Hypothesis is doing is impressive. The 'push back to the PR magic' PR is https://github.com/HypothesisWorks/hypothesis/pull/1562.\r\n\r\nSo I moved test-requirements.txt and ci/rtd-requirements.txt to the pip-compile format, but maybe we should keep a .in version in order to 1/ keep track of the direct dependencies and 2/ keep the comments we had until now? Of course, that's what Hypothesis does: https://github.com/HypothesisWorks/hypothesis/tree/master/requirements :)\r\n\r\nAnd yeah, I would be happy to remove my commits here and let @Zac-HD work on this! ðŸ˜„ ",
