  "body": "Well, I enabled `automerge: true` anyway, so at least we won't have to manually click the button each time a new package is released (just like we don't right now).\r\n\r\nBefore we can merge this I think we need to at least:\r\n\r\n* Tell travis and appveyor not to build `renovate/*` branches in the main repo\r\n* Extend our requirements files to have a complete list of packages + pins (maybe pip-tools can do this?)",
