  "body": "No strong preferences on the .in files... they can go next to the .txt files I guess, unless someone has a better idea?\r\n\r\nThat is unfortunate that pip-compile didn't preserve the environment marker... reading issues like https://github.com/jazzband/pip-tools/issues/635 , it sounds like it is intended to preserve it?
