  "body": "Using pip-compile from pip-tools is the best way to pin all indirect dependencies, but I think we need to make sure that renovate runs pip-compile itself? For example, say dependency A starts depending on dependency A1: you want to pin both A and A1 when we start depending on a new A version, and that's only possible with a new pip-compile run.\r\n\r\nIf that's not an option, I guess only pinning direct dependencies is a better compromise?",
