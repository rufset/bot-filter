  "body": "It looks like [Greenkeeper](https://greenkeeper.io) seems to be the most powerful and recommended dep mgmt tool for JS projects, so I think I'm going to investigate using it.\n\nFurthermore, we should probably decide on commit message guidelines as well. Angular has [widely adopted commit message guidelines](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#-git-commit-guidelines) which I think would be a good choice for us. We can use [validate-commit-msg](https://github.com/kentcdodds/validate-commit-msg) to enforce it, and recommend tools like [commitizen](https://www.npmjs.com/package/commitizen) to make it super easy for contributors. This will help us with things like [changelogs](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/conventional-changelog), for example.\n\nAlso, if we want to integrate tools like semantic-release (see #4565) in the future, having these conventions in place makes it really easy.\n",
