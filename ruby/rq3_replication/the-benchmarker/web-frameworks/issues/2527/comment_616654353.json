  "body": "@waghanza changes made!\r\n\r\nAs for the bot, I'm not aware of anything that will automatically track changes from Swift. The closest I've seen is the [script used by GH actions](https://github.com/actions/virtual-environments/blob/master/images/linux/scripts/installers/swift.sh) to always install the latest version of Swift. Since it's all Docker, you could always do `FROM swift:latest`",
