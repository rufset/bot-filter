  "body": "Looks like [this commit](https://github.com/the-benchmarker/web-frameworks/commit/04a4a3ce53b21b7e630caf78653d3a1d247916bb#diff-40316ede2773739cc5371ee064aafb19L3) broke the `go.mod` by removing the `+incompatible` suffix from chi.\r\n\r\nAs chi is > v1, it either needs `v3` in its import path (which it doesn't appear to have) or it needs to be marked as an incompatible package to work with Go modules.\r\n\r\nDependabot should definitely do a better job of telling you what caused the error - I'll make sure we get that fixed today. In the future the error message will be included in issues like these.",
