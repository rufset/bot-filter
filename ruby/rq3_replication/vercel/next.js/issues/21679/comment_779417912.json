  "body": "> You can now opt-in to webpack 5 support using the following `next.config.js`:\r\n> \r\n> ```js\r\n> // next.config.js\r\n> module.exports = {\r\n>   future: { webpack5: true }\r\n> }\r\n> ```\r\n\r\n**I've searched the release docs, as well as the Next.js website - is this documented somewhere besides this issue thread?**  \r\n\r\nUsing `v10.0.5`,  Storybook x Next.js monorepo users already had a difficult time enabling Webpack 5. After reading through #13341, I was finally able to find the correct `resolutions` configuration for my particular monorepo setup. \r\n\r\nAfter upgrading to `v10.0.6`, the `resolutions` config was a moot point - I was unable to run my app without receiving configuration schema errors. It seemed that Webpack 5 was no longer being resolved. Not entirely sure, but I'm guessing this can be traced back to the removal of the `webpack` dependency, as with this issue.\r\n\r\nThe code snippet above, however, is what I needed to run my app without errors. If there isn't already, it would be nice to have a discussion dedicated to Webpack 5 support thats regularly updated.\r\n\r\n@timneutkens\r\n",
