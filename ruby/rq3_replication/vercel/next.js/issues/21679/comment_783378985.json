  "body": "> It's so sad that this broke my production deployment on Vercel as well without me changing even a line of code.\r\n> \r\n> UPDATE:\r\n> So I just noticed that if you have\r\n> \"next\": \"^10.0.4\",\r\n> in you package.json file, and you update one of your deps/devDeps, it changed the lock file to this\r\n> \"@next/env@10.0.7\" !!\r\n> \r\n> So I just change it to this by removing the symbol ^\r\n> \"next\": \"10.0.4\",\r\n> remove the lock file, remove node modules, and re-install everyting and the lock file now return to normal\r\n> \"@next/env@10.0.4\"\r\n> \r\n> And now it works!!\r\n\r\nNot sure why NextJS decided to change the environment to 10.0.7 when obviously I only want to use 10.0.4.\r\n@revskill10 ",
