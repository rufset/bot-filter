  "body": "> @techandmedia It's clear.\r\n> My goal is to integrate Ant design with tailwindcss with latest Next.js, do you have any example or guideline ? Thanks !\r\n\r\nWhy would you need both Ant Design and Tailwind CSS at the same time, maintaining a single source of truth of CSS is hard enough and you're trying to use both? I don't think it's a good idea. Anyway, this thread is about webpack error, not CSS, so you might want to open another thread.",
