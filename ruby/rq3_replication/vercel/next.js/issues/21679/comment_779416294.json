  "body": "@timneutkens, with regards the _Canary_ patch for Next.js, is my understanding correct that it should provide a globally available `webpack` instance that would satisfy requirements of packages that used to depend on it?\r\n\r\nI have installed webpack@4 as a dependency of my package and that worked using version 10.0.6 of `next`, also didn't notice a change in my final build size. It also deployed and the site works.\r\n\r\nI tried to run `next@canary` (tried 10.0.7-canary.4 and *-canary.8)  and ran the build with `next-pwa` (naturally still the one some are having issues with) and the build fails again. \r\n\r\n### Question\r\n\r\nShould there be some extra action taken to ensure the other packages know it exists? Like a flag or something? The release didn't have much info about how the change is usable or if it was just an automatically available thing.\r\n\r\n(sorry for pinging if that is a problem, sure you have been getting a bunch of mails, please respond when you have the time)",
