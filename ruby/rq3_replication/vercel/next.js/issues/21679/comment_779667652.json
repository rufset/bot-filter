  "body": "10.0.7 was released that holds the patch that solves the majority case where `require('webpack')` is used inside of webpack plugins: https://github.com/vercel/next.js/releases/tag/v10.0.7\r\n\r\n@lexusdrumgold we're going to provide guidance on enabling webpack 5 soon (so that everyone upgrades). Shipping both versions of webpack inside of Next.js was a part of that for dual-loading. `resolutions` only applies to dependencies so that's why it didn't work between versions (note that webpack 5 support was in beta).\r\n\r\n@ReeceM the require hook is automatically inserted so it should work automatically.",
