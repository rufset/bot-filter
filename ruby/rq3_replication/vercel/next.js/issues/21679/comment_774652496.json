  "body": "I think for the most part, most are probably using `webpack@4` will solve most issues, I haven't seen any change in the build sizes, most of them actually got a 'little' bit smaller.\r\n\r\nRight now, I just did the following:\r\n\r\n`npm update`, this bumped next.js to `v10.0.6`, and currently the package that had an issue `next-pwa` goes to `v5.0.5`.\r\n\r\nBecause next-pwa has version constraints, I then installed `webpack@^4.0` which resulted in `\"webpack\": \"^4.46.0\",` being installed in the package.json file. NPM can pick the best version of webpack that way that satisfies the needs of all your packages.\r\n\r\nI saw that there is some attempts to implement the suggestion by Tim to account for the packages that use the web pack version from Next.js. That seems to be a version 10.0.7\r\n\r\nBut personally, the fact that it was included in the builds anyway to begin with wouldn't make any difference to including it directly as a dependency. Also noting the fact that with the `next-pwa` package, `workbox` from is actually the one that needs webpack and it has it as a peer dependency. Which from my understanding,\r\n\r\n### Below are the two builds, one with 10.0.5 and one with 10.0.6\r\n\r\n![10 0 5](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2767904/107144132-b24b4480-6941-11eb-9b84-f7e15f34649d.png)\r\n10.0.5\r\n\r\n![10 0 6](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2767904/107144143-c8f19b80-6941-11eb-9798-0f0728f85676.png)\r\n10.0.6\r\n\r\n\r\nI can confirm that this removes the error thats that I was seeing. Also for any comparison, this is the dependencies of my package.json\r\n\r\n```son\r\n\"dependencies\": {\r\n    \"@fullhuman/postcss-purgecss\": \"^3.1.3\",\r\n    \"animate.css\": \"^4.1.1\",\r\n    \"bulma\": \"^0.9.1\",\r\n    \"bulma-pricingtable\": \"^0.2.0\",\r\n    \"classnames\": \"^2.2.6\",\r\n    \"date-fns\": \"^2.17.0\",\r\n    \"next\": \"^10.0.6\",\r\n    \"next-pwa\": \"^5.0.5\",\r\n    \"postcss-preset-env\": \"^6.7.0\",\r\n    \"prismic-javascript\": \"^3.0.2\",\r\n    \"prismic-reactjs\": \"^1.3.3\",\r\n    \"react\": \"^17.0.1\",\r\n    \"react-collapse\": \"^5.1.0\",\r\n    \"react-dom\": \"^17.0.1\",\r\n    \"sitemap\": \"^6.3.5\",\r\n    \"webpack\": \"^4.46.0\",\r\n    \"wysiwyg.css\": \"0.0.3\"\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nEdit: also, sorry I know it's a Sunday, I would probably forget about this come Monday.",
