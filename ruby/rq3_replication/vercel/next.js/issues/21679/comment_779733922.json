  "body": "> @timneutkens Could you maybe require webpack 5 to be enabled a different way, eg. via an environment variable?\r\n\r\nWe're going to have everyone opt-in to webpack 5 over time so having it as an environment variable would not be ideal. Especially when we start automatically enabling webpack 5 for applications that do not have custom webpack configuration. Over time the double-loading of next.config.js can go away.\r\n\r\nNote that we've spend tremendous effort in making sure that this upgrade path to webpack 5 is as smooth as it can be and automatically enabled for applications where we know for sure that webpack 5 will work. For cases where you have custom webpack configuration we're going to warn on bootup asking to enable the `future.webpack5` flag manually (and upgrade your custom plugins).",
