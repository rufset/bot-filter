  "body": "If helps anyone, I had this same problem because of the css loader @zeit/next-sass that has been deprecated. This package is now supported in Next.js out of the box, but using it in new versions of next gave me this weird message error of Cannot find module 'webpack'.\r\ntldr; Drop next-sass, next now has default sass support. \r\n\r\n",
