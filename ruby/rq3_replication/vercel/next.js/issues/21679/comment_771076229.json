  "body": "> Same issue here. In our weekly depfu dependency bumps the GitHub action CI failed to build NextJS code because of this issue: https://github.com/skyra-project/skyra.pw/pull/230/checks?check_run_id=1801004086\r\n> \r\n> Edit: upgrading to webpack 5 by adding it to dev dependencies, resolutions and adding `future: { webpack5: true }` to `next.config.js` (as suggested by @Manikanta-20 [here](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues/21679#issuecomment-770198142)) worked as a fix. It's still an issue though, of course.\r\n\r\nIndeed, it solves the issue but when i'm running `next build`, I now have these warnings : \r\n```txt\r\ninfo  - Creating an optimized production build .<w> [webpack.cache.PackFileCacheStrategy] Caching failed for pack: Error: Can't resolve 'fsevents' in '/home/divlo/Documents/Thream/website/node_modules/next/node_modules/chokidar'\r\n<w> while resolving 'fsevents' in /home/divlo/Documents/Thream/website/node_modules/next/node_modules/chokidar to a directory\r\ninfo  - Creating an optimized production build ...<w> [webpack.cache.PackFileCacheStrategy] Caching failed for pack: Error: Can't resolve 'fsevents' in '/home/divlo/Documents/Thream/website/node_modules/next/node_modules/chokidar'\r\n<w> while resolving 'fsevents' in /home/divlo/Documents/Thream/website/node_modules/next/node_modules/chokidar to a directory\r\ninfo  - Creating an optimized production build ..<w> [webpack.cache.PackFileCacheStrategy] Caching failed for pack: Error: Can't resolve 'fsevents' in '/home/divlo/Documents/Thream/website/node_modules/next/node_modules/chokidar'\r\n<w> while resolving 'fsevents' in /home/divlo/Documents/Thream/website/node_modules/next/node_modules/chokidar to a directory\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlso, I guess it's only a temporary fix, I don't think it's viable to add `future: { webpack5: true }` in `next.config.js` and to install `webpack` as `devDependencies`, I would rather `next` manage these.",
