  "body": "Removing `@zeit/next-css` helps, but there are other packages that depends on it like `@zeit/next-less`.\r\n\r\nI had to remove those as well, and in the case of `@zeit/next-less`, I had to replace it with custom Webpack rules to handle `.less`. With `@zeit/next-css` deprecated, I am wondering what is the \"new\" solution to using `cssLoaderConfig` ?\r\n \r\n EDIT: I have a hacky workaround in place that works using some internals:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst { loader } = require(\"next/dist/build/webpack/config/helpers\");\r\nconst { getGlobalCssLoader } = require(\"next/dist/build/webpack/config/blocks/css/loaders\");\r\n```",
