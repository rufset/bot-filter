  "body": "Same issue here. In our weekly depfu dependency bumps the GitHub action CI failed to build NextJS code because of this issue: https://github.com/skyra-project/skyra.pw/pull/230/checks?check_run_id=1801004086\r\n\r\nEdit: upgrading to webpack 5 by adding it to dev dependencies, resolutions and adding `future: { webpack5: true }` to `next.config.js` (as suggested by @Manikanta-20 [here](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues/21679#issuecomment-770198142)) worked as a fix. It's still an issue though, of course.",
