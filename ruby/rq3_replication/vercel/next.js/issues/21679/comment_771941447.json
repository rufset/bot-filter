  "body": "This happens because Next.js 10.0.6 introduces support for dual-loading webpack as part of our work towards providing an incremental way to go from webpack 4 to webpack 5 without breaking all Next.js apps. To achieve dual-loading we now bundle both webpack 4 and webpack 5 into Next.js, effectively removing the `webpack` dependency from the published package.\r\n\r\nYou can now opt-in to webpack 5 support using the following `next.config.js`:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// next.config.js\r\nmodule.exports = {\r\n  future: { webpack5: true }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith this change it seems that some Next.js apps that customize the webpack configuration ([see the docs](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next.config.js/custom-webpack-config)) are including webpack plugins that rely on the underlying app to have the `webpack` package available which would break with strict module resolving like pnp/pnpm or when the underlying package uses webpack but does not have the `webpack` dependency (like the case that Next.js has now). The solution to this would be to register a require hook in the Next.js bootup that links `require('webpack')` to the Next.js bundled version of webpack.\r\n\r\nThis does leave a chicken/egg problem because the `require('webpack')` in your apps is running the moment Next.js loads `next.config.js`, but that file sets the future flag for webpack 5 meaning we wouldn't be able to alias it before loading `next.config.js`. The solution for that would be to change the webpack 5 enabling to be an env var or something like that.\r\n\r\nWe've opened an issue for it here: #21789\r\n\r\nRandom note for webpack plugin maintainers: webpack 5 introduced `compiler.webpack` exposing the webpack object to plugins without having to `require('webpack')` https://github.com/webpack/webpack/blob/master/lib/Compiler.js#L191.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
