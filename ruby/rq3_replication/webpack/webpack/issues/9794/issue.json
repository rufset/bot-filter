  "title": "react-styleguidist production build broken: Error: RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded",
  "body": "I am using Webpack `4.41.0` and I have issue with production build of documentations.\r\n\r\nI got all my documentation production build broken for some reason.\r\n\r\nExample: https://rollup-umd.github.io/test/\r\n\r\n`Error:  RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded`\r\n\r\nI haven't change anything in my source code. It just happen to be broken. \r\n\r\nI can't remove UglifyJS plugin because `react-styleguidist` forbid it. \r\n\r\n**Current behavior**\r\n\r\nAfter running `npm run styleguide:build`, I have:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nbundle.ebc589be.js:65 Uncaught RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded\r\n    at e (bundle.ebc589be.js:65)\r\n    at e (bundle.ebc589be.js:65)\r\n   ...\r\nShow 170 more frames\r\n```\r\n\r\n**To reproduce**\r\n\r\n- Example: https://rollup-umd.github.io/test\r\n- Local Reproduction:\r\n\r\n```\r\ngit clone git@github.com:rollup-umd/test.git\r\ncd test\r\nnpm i\r\nnpm run styleguide:build\r\nnpm i -g serve\r\nserve public\r\n# open chrome and http://localhost:5000\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\n- Work as in `npm run styleguide`.\r\n\r\n**Related information**\r\n\r\nIt was working 24h ago, since then, I have not change anything in all my sources codes.\r\n\r\n**All my production build** in all my projects are down.\r\n\r\nI believe (unless I am wrong but to me it is the only valid reason): the dep tree as changed.\r\n\r\nFor those who ask why I don't have a lock file: It is because we do not use `package-lock.json` in distributed modules, because lock file are for application.\r\n\r\nDoes anybody have an idea of what changes recently?\r\nIs there a way I can trace and find what cause all my documentations to be broken?",
