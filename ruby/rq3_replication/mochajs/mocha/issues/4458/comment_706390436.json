  "body": "yeah failure is related to that, but unsure what's wrong. haven't had it fail before! could be something in the lockfile or the github actions cache... or just windows flake or windows flake on a specific node version (again, which hasn't surfaced). \n\nwe need to be certain the failure is unrelated though. I can't view the diff of the lockfile on my phone, maybe you can diff the workerpool subtree with what's in `master` and assert it's identical. if so, then it's likely unrelated to the changes here ",
