  "body": "The original `coffee-script` package has been deprecated by its author, saying it moved to `coffeescript`. I'm not sure what's the benefit of testing the deprecated package instead of the currently-used one.\r\n\r\nThe upgrades are not \"just because\". There are upstream fixes in those third parties to use-cases you wouldn't necessarily test/account for. There's also the number of duplicate files (in user's node_modules) caused by `mocha` pinning third-parties to older versions.",
