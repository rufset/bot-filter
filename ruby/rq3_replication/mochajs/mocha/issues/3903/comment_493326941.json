  "body": "There is a saucelab IE11 error, restarts do not succeed. Is Karma upgrade the guilty one?\r\n\r\nLesson to learn: branches with dependencies upgrade should be pushed to this repo, not contributor's repo. Additional tests (browsers?) are run this way.\r\n\r\nEDIT: @AviVahl  I'm reverting this PR. For sure Coffeescript v2 is not compatible with IE11 without transpiler, but there must be more breakages. Maybe you can give it another try.",
