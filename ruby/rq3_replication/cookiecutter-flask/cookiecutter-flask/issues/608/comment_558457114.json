  "body": "Hi @TobKed! Sorry for delayed response. My preference would be to keep Dependabot instead of moving to pyup, especially now that Dependabot is now a Github project. To that end, I've submitted a PR to the dependbot repo (https://github.com/dependabot/dependabot-core/pull/1537) to add support for Jinja templates in requirements files.\r\n\r\nAssuming the enhancement is approved, I think we would be ready to merge https://github.com/cookiecutter-flask/cookiecutter-flask/pull/607!",
