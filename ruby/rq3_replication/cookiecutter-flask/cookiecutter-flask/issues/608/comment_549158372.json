  "body": "I was thinking about this but I am concerned about keeping dependencies  in two places. The logic would be little bit hidden and harder to understand. `if/else` statement in `requirements.txt` is more explicit. I've started making research on this topic and I see **cookiecutter-django** uses https://github.com/pyupio/pyup.\r\nHere is example of PR with updated requirements file with jinja expressions: https://github.com/pydanny/cookiecutter-django/pull/2278.\r\nWDYT about **pyup**?",
