  "body": "If we're going to use bot to keep dependencies up to date, I'd recommend [renovate](https://renovateapp.com/) ([example](https://github.com/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=user%3Aikatyang+author%3Aapp%2Frenovate)) as it can be configured to auto-merge specific semver level for specific package.\r\n\r\nBut I think we should not touch them unless it's necessary since we should aim to be stable, sometimes they'll introduce unexpected behavior that we don't have tests covered.",
