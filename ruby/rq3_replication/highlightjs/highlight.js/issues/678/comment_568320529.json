  "body": "> For what it's worth, I would still prefer a /dist folder in the highlight.js npm package or a separate npm package with the cdn output. I wouldn't use a git based dependency like this for a work project \r\n\r\nWhat if we pushed the CDN repo to npm ourselves under another name (`highlightjs-assets`, etc), would that not be a good resolution?",
