  "title": "Pre-compiled files?",
  "body": "I guess I'm not the only one looking for a way to get a pre-compiled files of hljs. So far, I tried several ways to overcome this, but none of the following was completely satisfying.\n## Bower\n\nBower is probably where pre-compiled files would fit best, but the package available is _not official_ and _outdated_ (as you are aware). \n## npm\n\nThe package distributed on npm is made for â€” and that's fine, I guess, since this is what npm is primarily made for. As I understand it I cannot use the node package to embed it on a website. So, instead I tried to build it using Gulp. Since it's possible to specify any GitHub repository (if it comes with a `package.json`) as a dependency, I tried building hljs using node.\n\n``` json\n\"devDependencies\": {\n  \"highlight.js\":   \"isagalaev/highlight.js\"\n},\n \"scripts\": {\n  \"postinstall\": \"node node_modules/highlight.js/tools/build.js :common\"\n}\n```\n\nUnfortunately, this does not seem to work due to a problem with file permissions (I wonder if including an empty `build` folder would solve this). Next I tried [gulp-shell](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-shell) to build directly from gulp, but the tasks aborts due to missing dependencies (of hljs).\n## cdnjs\n\nUltimately, I ended up using a Gulp task that downloads JS and CSS from cdnjs. It works, but it left me with a somewhat _awkward_ feeling.\n\nIs their another possibility I'm overlooking? Are there any plans to make this easier in the future? I suspect many users would welcome the idea to get pre-compiled files and Bower is _maybe_ the right place for it. Just my two cents.\n",
