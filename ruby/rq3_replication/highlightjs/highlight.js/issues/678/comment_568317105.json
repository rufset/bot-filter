  "body": "Following up on https://github.com/highlightjs/highlight.js/issues/678#issuecomment-72732720\r\n\r\nIf a `package.json` was included in https://github.com/highlightjs/cdn-release that would work well enough for a personal project I'm working on. The `package.json` can be dead simple, just needs a name and version.\r\n\r\nAs an example I forked cdn-release, and created a new branch from tag `9.17.1` called `9.17.1-with-package`: https://github.com/rajsite/cdn-release/tree/9.17.1-with-package\r\n\r\nThe `package.json` content was:\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"name\":\"@rajsite/highlightjs-cdn-release\",\r\n  \"version\": \"0.0.1\",\r\n  \"private\": true\r\n}\r\n```\r\nWhere the name I'm using is under a public scope I own (`@rajsite`) so it won't accidentally conflict elsewhere.\r\n\r\nThen I was able to add it to a project using:\r\n```\r\nnpm install git://github.com/rajsite/cdn-release.git#9.17.1-with-package\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor what it's worth, I would still prefer a `/dist` folder in the highlight.js npm package or a separate npm package with the cdn output. I wouldn't use a git based dependency like this for a work project (we have tools to cache public registry packages it would not mesh well with) and it would be a uncommon transitive dependency for other projects to rely on (it won't play well with semantic versioning, etc).",
