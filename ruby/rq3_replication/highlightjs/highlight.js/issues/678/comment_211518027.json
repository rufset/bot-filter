  "body": "@danvk There is also downsides:\n- There is [Browserify](http://browserify.org/) and [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/). They have become the de facto standard in Frontend programming, bundling every `require`d dependency automatically.\n- Bundling dist files makes NPM packages heavier. Given the nature of deep & wide dependency trees in the JS world, this weighs in significantly.\n- [A lot of other projects use highlight.js](https://www.npmjs.com/browse/depended/highlight.js), [not only on the client side](https://github.com/isagalaev/highlight.js/issues/1086#issue-134898881). For these, bundles are unnecessary weight.\n- NPM hast `install` hooks to build stuff on install if that is required. NPM packages with large data sets and/or binaries do this.\n",
