  "body": "@noraj Interesting, but is that directly comparable?  The problem is we have two (at least) entirely different deliverables -- packaged very differently... the browser/CDN build and the node.js build.  Currently our npm is the node build.\r\n\r\nIsn't font awesome really just all client-side resources?
