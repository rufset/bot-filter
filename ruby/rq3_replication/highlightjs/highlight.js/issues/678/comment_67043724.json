  "body": "Hi Ivan, that looks promising. Is there anything speaking against the addition of a `package.json` to that repo, so one could download it with npm as well? Afaik, a barebon private package would already do, e.g. \n\n``` json\n{\n  \"name\": \"highlight.js\",\n  \"version\": \"8.4.0\",\n  \"description\": \"a syntax highlighter written in JavaScript\",\n  \"private\": true,\n  \"license\": \"BSD\"\n}\n```\n",
