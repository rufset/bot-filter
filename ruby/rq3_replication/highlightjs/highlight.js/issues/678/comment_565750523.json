  "body": "> Because it's for a project that need to work offline and that need to be self-contained, so I need all the assets locally.\r\n\r\nWhy couldn't/wouldn't you just vendor it into a directory of your choice (from the CDN url or from the CDN repo) and then only download the file if it was missing?
