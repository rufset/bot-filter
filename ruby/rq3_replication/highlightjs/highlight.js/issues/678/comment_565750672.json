  "body": "I think what some people want is for `cdn-release` to just be packaged up into a NPM package called `highlight-js-assets` or something...\r\n\r\n- If you want to use Highlight.js server-side, use `highlight-js` package\r\n- If you want to use Highlight.js assets client-side, use `highlight-js-assets` package\r\n\r\nThoughts? That kind of makes sense to me.  What I'm less sure about is merging both into a single large repo.\r\n\r\n@marcoscaceres Do you have any thoughts on how other npm packages do this? Packages whose client code is DIFFERENT than their server code and who have reasons for using both in various contexts?",
