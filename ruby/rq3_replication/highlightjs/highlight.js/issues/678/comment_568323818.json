  "body": "> > For what it's worth, I would still prefer a /dist folder in the highlight.js npm package or a separate npm package with the cdn output. I wouldn't use a git based dependency like this for a work project\r\n> \r\n> What if we pushed the CDN repo to npm ourselves under another name (`highlightjs-assets`, etc), would that not be a good resolution?\r\n\r\nThat would make sense to me. It would be nice if the versions matched and LICENSE + README were included as well (a License file is missing right now from what I can tell).\r\n\r\nRight now from cdn-release I'm pulling in the min plus a couple of additional languages as separate JS files from cdn git. It's not perfect for code size / number of network requests but helps with getting started and kicking the tires.\r\n\r\nseparate npm package sounds great! üëç",
