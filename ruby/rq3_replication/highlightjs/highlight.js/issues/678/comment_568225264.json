  "body": "> @noraj Interesting, but is that directly comparable? The problem is we have two (at least) entirely different deliverables -- packaged very differently... the browser/CDN build and the node.js build. Currently our npm is the node build.\r\n\r\nYep. I thought you wanted to make it like that:\r\n\r\n> * If you want to use Highlight.js server-side, use `highlight-js` package (for node)\r\n> \r\n> * If you want to use Highlight.js assets client-side, use `highlight-js-assets` package (for browser/CDN)\r\n\r\nOne npm package per usage/target. So just add in the git repository a structure like that:\r\n\r\n```\r\nhljs\r\n└── js-packages\r\n    └── @highlightjs\r\n        ├── highlight-js\r\n        │   └── package.json\r\n        └── highlight-js-assets\r\n            └── package.json\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhere `@highlightjs` is the npm scope. Then you can use symbolic links to point some already existing files from the root git repository into each package sub-directory or build them with a gulp task for exemple in case of the webpack for the browser/CDN package.\r\n\r\nSo no it's not **totally** comparable to FA but most of the packaging and delivery idea is here The only difference is that they package logically different stuff and you want to package the \"same\" stuff for two different targets with some variances.",
