  "body": "Thank you for the tip, @escapedcat. I know I can. But I maintain numerous projects. If this is changed in @commitlint/config-conventional, then my automatic dependency updater would make a pull request for me in each of those projects and all I'd have to do is merge it. Hey, I'm just being lazy, like the rest of us.\r\n\r\nAnd I do find it difficult to maintain below 72 anyway, some times.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint/blob/5fd8a69cc1255f493447fac68264481d3e2e2ceb/%40commitlint/config-conventional/index.js#L6\r\n\r\nI don't know the other considerations for this value. I see a request to turn this up to 100 for Angular #303 .",
