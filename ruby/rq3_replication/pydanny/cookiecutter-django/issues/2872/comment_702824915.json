  "body": "As you pointed out, we already have some issues with manual reviewing. Some bugs appear due to changes in this project, others from some of our dependencies. \r\n\r\nAt least when we merge things manually, I might see a correlation between a bug report and a recent merge, which might be a bit more difficult to keep track if this is all automated. Merging dependencies updates is not taking a lot of time at the moment, but it's not done blindly either. \r\n\r\nFor example, for the recent `pytest` update  (#2859), I double checked their changelog and noticed a breaking change. I quickly checked the codebase to make sure our fixtures were only using keyword arguments. All fixtures are all executed, in our tests, so this was probably not necessary, but this tells how much I trust our tests ðŸ˜„ \r\n\r\nThe main driver for this change is to reduce maintenance burden on maintainers, and I _really_ appreciate the effort. However, FÃ¡bio's comment made me realise that it might have the opposite effect.",
