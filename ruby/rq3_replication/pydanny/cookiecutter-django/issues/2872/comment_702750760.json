  "body": "Sorry for being late in this discussion:\r\nWith the proposed auto-merge how to manage when an update to a dependency requires a change and that change does not necessarily break the build in CI?\r\n\r\nI personally read the release notes and see the diff changes for the libraries before merging a pull-request that updates a dependency and I don't see how it can be automated with 100% reliability in the final result of the merge. Yes, changes like these are few, but they do exist.",
