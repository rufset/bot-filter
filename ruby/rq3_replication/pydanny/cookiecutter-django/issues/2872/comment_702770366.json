  "body": "I think the amount of breaking changes combined with the amount of time checking each package takes plus the amount of packages makes this worthwhile. #2745 came 5 months after the error popped up from ca7fcb8f625af000693bc1f1e66d0730850af62b\r\n\r\nPerhaps a fix could be to mark all production.txt requirements to not auto merge? Would it also be necessary for local.txt? I think that part is covered by the current test cases.\r\n\r\nSo the fix would be to add the tag `local` and `update` tag to each requirement that isn't a production.txt requirement for pyup PRs. Then in the automerge, the `MERGE_LABELS` environment variable would check that both tags are there in order to update.",
