  "body": "I opened an issue https://github.com/chardet/chardet/issues/113. It is probably good to freeze the chardet 2.3.0 version on `binaryornot` and release a new version.\r\n\r\n> Any ideas why CI hasn't raised this? Is it because we don't generate the PyCharm files?\r\n\r\n`chardet` is a `binaryornot` dependency, and is not a direct dependency of cookiecutter-django, so @pyup-bot did not send a pull-request when chardet 3.0.0 was released, and consequently travis did not run ...\r\n\r\n@pydanny  Would also be good to enable https://pyup.io/ on `binaryornot` repository",
