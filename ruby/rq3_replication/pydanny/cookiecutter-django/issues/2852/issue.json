  "title": "Add Github action to auto merge dependabot and pyup security updates if all tests pass.",
  "body": "## Description\r\n\r\nWhat are you proposing? How should it be implemented?\r\n\r\nI propose to add a new GitHub action or job that will auto merge pull requests from the `pyup bot` and the `dependabot` should the PR so created has no merge conflicts with master and all tests also pass.\r\n\r\nThis will be very similar to how [pre-commit tool versions](https://github.com/pydanny/cookiecutter-django/blob/master/.github/workflows/pre-commit-autoupdate.yml#L28) in the repo root are kept up to date.\r\n\r\n## Rationale\r\n\r\nWhy should this feature be implemented?\r\n\r\nThis would make updating requirements easier and more automated and would likely also make the project more secure. The tests are used to make the decision to merge updates from dependabot and pyup right now anyway.",
