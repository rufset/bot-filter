  "body": "As I mentioned in the pull request, dependabot is out of scope of this IMO, as it doesn't work well with cookiecutter templated files. Dependabot preview is the old version, before Github integrated it. The native Dependabot doesn't need to be enabled, uses a different config file and is [part of GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/administering-a-repository/enabling-and-disabling-version-updates).",
