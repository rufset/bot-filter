  "title": "Auto merge Dependabot updates",
  "body": "## Description\r\n\r\nFixes #2852 Adds auto-merging pip updates to this repository using dependabot to alleviate @browniebroke 's workload.\r\n\r\n## Rationale\r\n\r\nMake updating this repository less stressful. You can view the test repository here: https://github.com/Andrew-Chen-Wang/test-dependabot-automerge You can see that, when one update happens, the rest of the PRs close and are superseded with a new PR, as shown here: https://github.com/Andrew-Chen-Wang/test-dependabot-automerge/pull/3#issuecomment-701741950\r\n\r\nThis also means we don't need pyup anymore, especially since dependabot covers everything pyup does and auto merges and rebases in case of new updates to the PR.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nNote: when GitHub acquired dependabot, they disabled the auto merge feature [natively for security reasons](https://github.com/dependabot/dependabot-core/issues/1973#issuecomment-640918321), so that's why I had to create the GitHub action. I took the GitHub action from a Medium post, but I just can't find the blog anymore......\r\n\r\nAH!
