  "body": "Interesting, didn't notice it failed with the Jinja2 templating; I probably got too tired, sorry about that.\r\n\r\nI can rework the GitHub to auto merge pyup instead by changing the actor. If you don't mind, for the CI check, I'd like to use: https://github.com/WyriHaximus/github-action-wait-for-status for checking the status. The merge step in this case will use an `if` the status is successful and if not, the merge will not happen.",
