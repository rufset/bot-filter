  "body": "Very nice! I think we should be careful with this one. A few questions I have:\r\n\r\n- What happens if the build doesn't pass? From a quick look, it doesn't seem to check the build status...\r\n- Did you check that Dependabot supports having Jinja markup in requirements files?\r\n  In latest version of your example repo, Django is updated [in production](https://github.com/Andrew-Chen-Wang/test-dependabot-automerge/blob/a249161f233f403737b6b6ee2c636375df6c2386/%7B%7B%20cookiecutter.project_slug%20%7D%7D/requirements/production.txt#L1), but [not in local](https://github.com/Andrew-Chen-Wang/test-dependabot-automerge/blob/a249161f233f403737b6b6ee2c636375df6c2386/%7B%7B%20cookiecutter.project_slug%20%7D%7D/requirements/local.txt#L1).\r\n  The difference between the 2 files is that local has some Jinja markup for a conditional. I think that's of the main thing preventing up from replacing pyup by Dependabot. It's well supported by pyup.\r\n- Another neat feature from pyup is the ability to \"filter\" updates, that we use often, and [currently for Celery](https://github.com/pydanny/cookiecutter-django/blob/1a701ed70f3275b282d8fc3a1d98fde36e4e35f5/%7B%7Bcookiecutter.project_slug%7D%7D/requirements/base.txt#L20), we can say `!= 4.4.7` for example. [Celery 4.4.7 is a bit broken](https://github.com/pydanny/cookiecutter-django/issues/2827) currently, and we don't want to update to it, but the Celery bug isn't something that breaks our build, so an upgrade would be automerged, and if we downgrade, it would be re-updated again...\r\n\r\nI think we can't switch to Dependanbot yet, but if we can get the build status checked before merging, that would work with pyup changes.",
