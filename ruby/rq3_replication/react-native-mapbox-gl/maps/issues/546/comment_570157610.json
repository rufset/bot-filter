  "body": "> Hey, looks good and approved. Sorry for the slow review, Christmas holidays and all that :)\r\n> \r\n> You able to merge, or want me to do it?\r\n\r\nHey ðŸ‘‹ \r\n\r\nThanks, no worries - I assumed as much, hope you had some relaxing days.\r\n\r\nI'm right in the middle of adding an example as well.\r\n\r\nAfterwards feel free to merge - I do not have any rights.\r\n\r\nPS: If it's ok for you I would request some rights to take care of the `depfu` PRs.\r\nFeel like they're bogging you down and I wouldn't have an issue looking after them once in a while.",
