  "body": "> unfortunately after this change pnpm will download package tarballs even when --shrinkwrap-only is used. According to the npm team, the only reliable way to tell whether a package has to be built is to check the real package.json from the tarball\r\n\r\nA few questions:\r\n\r\nWhen you say \"download the tarball\" do you mean it would get downloaded even if it's already present in the PNPM store?\r\n\r\nIs the NPM team saying that the huge dump of package.json returned from their REST endpoint may NOT accurately represent the actual contents of the package.json file? How would that happen?\r\n\r\nI understood that `--shrinkwrap-only` is intended to be a fast way to update **shrinkwrap.yaml**, in cases where you don't care about the node_modules folder (e.g. because you're going to push to a PR branch without building locally).  Is that true?  Or was this feature intended to be usable without any network connection at all?\r\n\r\nTo handle @rarkins 's issue,  couldn't you simply omit the corgi header if the `--shrinkwrap-only` option was specified?",
