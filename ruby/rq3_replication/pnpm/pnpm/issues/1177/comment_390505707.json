  "body": "@zkochan that's certainly a pity! \r\n\r\nWhat is the difference that enables `npm` itself to generate lock files without downloading tarballs, and can you update to do the same technique soon?\r\n\r\nI will monitor the performance impact in the app - disk churn when using EBS on AWS can really drag performance. I assume that due to `pnpm`'s design, that if I can persist the `pnpm` cache then that would alleviate most of the network burden, transferring it instead to be a disk burden? I did that previous with `yarn` but it was ultimately too much disk I/O that it slowed things down almost as much.",
