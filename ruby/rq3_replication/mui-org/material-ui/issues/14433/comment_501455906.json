  "body": "It's a bug in yarn 1.x as far as I know. Did you install it with `yarn workspace @material-ui/codemod @babel/core`?\r\n\r\n\r\n> Is temporarily turning off that flag in .yarnrc the only way\r\n\r\nTL;DR: yarn v2 will solve this\r\n\r\nYes. It's mainly there so that new contributors don't get a lockfile change on their first install or rather every clone having the same node_modules. We previously checked this different in CI but it also caused some issues with github dependencies.\r\n\r\n",
