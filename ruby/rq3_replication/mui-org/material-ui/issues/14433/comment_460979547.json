  "body": "> @eps1lon You need to rebase on next. This flag looks like a best practice, why do you want to revert it? [facebook/react:.circleci/config.yml@`master`#L32](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/master/.circleci/config.yml#L32).\r\n\r\nThen we can remove the CI task to check if the dependencies are up to date and add to CONTRIBUTING that you need to run `yarn --frozen-lockfile` locally. Otherwise you will get diffs on every yarn install locally.\r\n\r\nEdit: Also: best practice for library code is no lockfile and for apps with a lockfile. We mix both in this repo. Having a lockfile allows us to monitor transitive dependencies (which should be the responsibility of every library author IMO)",
