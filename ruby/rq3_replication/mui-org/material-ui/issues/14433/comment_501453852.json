  "body": "So, I needed to add `@babel/core` and `@babel/traverse` for building a whitelist for my `top-level-imports` codemod, and now I'm getting the \"Your lockfile needs to be updated, but yarn was run with `--frozen-lockfile`\" because of this change.  How do I force it to update the lockfile now?  Is temporarily turning off that flag in `.yarnrc` the only way?",
