  "body": "The offline-cache is used because the network in CircleCI is not reliable. We had repeated build failures because the network timed out. We didn't have any network issues after this change. \r\n\r\nI didn't explain this because it is/was just a reiteration of the original [PR/commit message](https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui/pull/12763) for this change. However you did not explain why this was suddenly not necessary anymore. Do you have a source that described the original problem and that it was fixed?\r\n\r\n> This flag was needed because CI failed while locally I succeeded.\r\n\r\nThat is just not a valid explanation. I expect more from contributors that open issues so if I ask you explicitly I expect that you follow a similar schema: \"What did you do? What did you expect? What happened? Why do you think this is a bug?\"\r\n\r\nFollowing the original commit history it looks like an issue with a dependency of `dtslint` and more specifically how some yarn versions handle github dependencies. This is almost certainly cause by different versions of yarn i.e. a (fixed) bug in `yarn`. It does not follow from this that we should change how our CI works.\r\n\r\nI'm more than happy to understand why having a frozen lockfile in CI is a good thing when not communicating that to our devs results in different dependency trees for local development and CI.\r\n\r\n> My builds run on circleci and I need no such hack, perhaps we drop the offline cache and drop the frozen lockfile?\r\n\r\nA documented configuration setting that is [used how documented is a hack](https://yarnpkg.com/blog/2016/11/24/offline-mirror/)?\r\n\r\n~I guess I just have to live with not knowing why frozen-lockfile is good. I don't have the intuition that you two seem to have.~ This was unnecessarily emotional so I'm sorry for that",
