  "title": "[core] Use frozen-lockfile by default",
  "body": "~Revert `--frozen-lockfile` change from #14050~\r\n\r\n~@rosskevin Didn't explain why he thought this was good. We have a dedicated CI task to check if the lockfile doesn't match `package.json`. This flag makes this task useless.~ I doesn't completely.\r\n\r\n~I would hope that CI and local development use the same dependencies which is what this lockfile is for. This also means that we test with the latest versions of our dependencies not (possibly) outdated versions from the lockfile.~\r\nRunning `yarn` locally creates a diff because `frozen-lockfile` is not default. This enables `frozen-lockfile` following yarnpkg/yarn#4147. ",
