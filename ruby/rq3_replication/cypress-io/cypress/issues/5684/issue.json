  "title": "Upgrade cli dependencies",
  "body": "The `cli/package.json` file declares a lot of dependencies, and they are all pinned to exact versions. This means they fall out of date quickly, and any other project that depends on `cypress` must pull in these old versions of these dependencies for `cypress`.\r\n\r\nThis pull request updates _all_ dependencies in `cli/package.json`. This is probably more extreme than what we want, but it's a good first pass to see how much we need to change the code to accommodate these dependency updates. I'm happy to break this up into smaller pull requests, if asked.",
