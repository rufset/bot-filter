  "body": "Thanks for the contribution! Below are some guidelines Cypress uses when doing PR reviews.\n\n- Please write `[WIP]` in the title of your Pull Request if your PR is not ready for review - someone will review your PR as soon as the `[WIP]` is removed.\n- Please familiarize yourself with the PR Review Checklist and feel free to make updates on your PR based on these guidelines.\n\n## PR Review Checklist\n\nIf any of the following requirements can't be met, leave a comment in the review selecting 'Request changes', otherwise 'Approve'. \n\n### User Experience\n\n- The feature/bugfix is self-documenting from within the product.\n- The change provides the end user with a way to fix their problem (no dead ends).\n\n### Functionality\n\n- The code works and performs its intended function with the correct logic.\n- Performance has been factored in (for example, the code cleans up after itself to not cause memory leaks).\n- The code guards against edge cases and invalid input and has tests to cover it.\n\n### Maintainability\n\n- The code is readable (too many nested 'if's are a bad sign).\n- Names used for variables, methods, etc, clearly describe their function.\n- The code is easy to understood and there are relevant comments explaining.\n- New algorithms are documented in the code with link(s) to external docs (flowcharts, w3c, chrome, firefox).\n- There are comments containing link(s) to the addressed issue (in tests and code).\n\n### Quality\n\n- The change does not reimplement code. \n- There's not a module from the ecosystem that should be used instead.\n- There is no redundant or duplicate code. \n- There are no irrelevant comments left in the code.\n- Tests are testing the codeâ€™s intended functionality in the best way possible.\n\n### Internal\n\n- The original issue has been tagged with a release in ZenHub.",
