  "body": "@singingwolfboy Closing in favor of https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/4226 which does exactly this. \r\n\r\nA large amount of the upgrades are breaking changes - dropping Node 4 and 6, which is why we have it slated for the breaking change release of Cypress. \r\n\r\nWe use renovatebot to update dependencies one by one for better tracking generally, so do not generally consider PRs for dep updates outside of the flow. See our [Contributing guide](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/blob/develop/CONTRIBUTING.md#dependencies) for more detail.\r\n\r\nI will open a new issue concerning @types/blob-util dep. Thanks!",
