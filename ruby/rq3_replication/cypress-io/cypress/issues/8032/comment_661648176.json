  "body": "@karlhorky Our team has decided that this is a change we would like to make. The body of work is a bit larger than is covered here in this PR, since there are some stickier things with version control going on when we build the binary. So, I've created a new issue to outline the work necessary. https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/8046 We'll have a new PR to address the full changes, so I'll be closing this one. \r\n\r\nThanks for bringing this up! I think it helped get the ball rolling on things.",
