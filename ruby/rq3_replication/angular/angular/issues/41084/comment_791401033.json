  "body": "@nbittich It's not necessary to do it on your side. It's only your decision. I think that the rest of the Angular community appreciate a weekly period as a compromise to get the latest updates, test them and react as soon as possible. With a longer period, it would mean that many things would concentrate on one point. Remember that the whole process also works as the third level of acceptance in the real world, based on thousands and thousands of apps.",
