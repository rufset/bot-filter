  "body": "As discussed with @IgorMinar, in order to avoid random breakages on CI, we should eventually pin all dependencies that may affect the outcome of tests and CI builds.\r\nIn order to also ensure that we are testing against latest versions in our supported ranges (and catch any dependency regressions early), we should have a process (preferrably automated) to regularly (daily?) upgrade all such dependencies.\r\n\r\nAction items (in random order):\r\n\r\n- [ ] Document all currently unpinned dependencies in `docs/dependencies.md`.\r\n       Currently known places where we use unpinned dependencies:\r\n         - All aio examples e2e tests (in `aio/`).\r\n         - Some integration tests (in `integration/`).\r\n- [ ] Document the process of upgrading them.\r\n- [ ] Pin them.\r\n- [ ] Gather all hardcoded versions in as few places as possible (e.g. `yarn.lock`, `env.sh`) to make it easier to upgrade.\r\n- [ ] Come up with a process to upgrade them.\r\n- [ ] Automate the upgrade process.",
