  "body": "> One will be against latest snapshots of dependencies\r\n\r\nDo I understand this flow correctly?\r\n\r\n- New code lands on `angular/angular` master\r\n- A snapshot build is pushed to `angular/core-builds`\r\n- Renovate should submit a PR back to `angular/angular` updating the integrations `package.json` to point to the new commit?\r\n\r\nAnd how exactly would it specify the \"latest snaphot\"? I notice that `angular/core-builds` seems to have both branches and tags, so I'm not sure I know what naming/tagging convention you have in use.\r\n\r\n> We'll change the integration test runner so that it kicks off the test N times, once for each package.json file.\r\n\r\nThe package.json files will be within separate subdirectories within that particular \"integration\" folder?",
